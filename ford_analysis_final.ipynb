The steering is decent, gas mileage is decent,  the horse power is decent and the overall handling is decent. The locks delay, the column mounted controls are terrible, the controls for the locks are in the middle which is idiotic. In my case with a hatchback, not much room, even if it\\'s deep, it\\'s literally exactly as wide (front to back) as a pizza bag. Seats fold down, but you got shit in the back seats sometimes, and you\\'re not typically delivering pizza. Speaking of the hatch.l: hold the button, wait, and then you can open. Because delayed reaction with the locks. The seats are hard, and that\\'s comparing everything to the basic ass 2012 Toyota Yaris hatch(great car for the basic assness). The transmission feels like it\\'s going to stall in drive, but sport mode works a little better. There\\'s not much room inside the car. You don\\'t want to have your left leg bent up with your knee resting on the door, because it\\'s just hard plastic, and it\\'s a narrow foot well. The sound system is basic. As far as driving through a town with strict cops, so you\\'re as casual as possible all the time, it\\'s uncomfortable, and shitty. The windshield wipers are pretty good though. The A/C is standard, the lights aren\\'t especially bright and overall... Buy a different car, unless you\\'re stubbornly in love with Ford, which you\\'d have to be. Or rather small. Which I\\'m 5\\'8\"\" 170 lbs, so if you\\'re RATHER small, you might enjoy. The sportiness looks are awkward IMO because it\\'s so narrow, but that\\'s just me.

But you can make things better.  2.  you can buy different brakes that create less dust. I dont know which brands or setups to recommend so you will have to look in the Fiesta ST forums online and do your research - there are definitely tons of threads about brakes on FiST forums. 2. There are ceramic wheel cleaners now. They will leave a ceramic coating on the wheels which will help the brake dust clean off easier next wash. You can also use ceramic wax or ceramic \"\"wax as you dry\"\" products.  You can use these on the black painted rims or the alloys.\\n\\nRight now I\\'m using Turtle Wax Ceramic Wet Wax. You spray it on your car after washing while it\\'s still wet and then dry. I wash my car first with a ceramic car wash and  a good clean sponge I only use on the paint,  then I clean the wheels with a seperate sponge. It\\'s cheaper and works just as good as wheel cleaner. I use a shammie to dry the car and a seperate microfiber cloth to whipe the wheels. Theres no scrubbing if you keep this up. Just wiping and polishing.

Gave the Fiesta a fair chance and quite honestly I really disliked the car in the end. The interior was a downgrade from the Polo both design and quality wise but what really killed the Fiesta for me and made me dislike it is that low roofline that\\'s directly in your view. The visibility was notably worse than the Polo\\'s and the roof felt like it was pushing down on you and it had this cramped feeling which I hated. I also much prefered the looks of the Polo when seeing the cars in person plus it\\'s a bit more practical. As far as I can tell the Fiesta\\'s only real advantage is that it\\'s a bit more sporty to drive (according to Youtube, haven\\'t driven it myself) but imo that\\'s nowhere near enough to offset all its disadvantages compared to the Polo, not even close.\\n\\n\\nIn the end I liked the Polo the most of the cars I saw and ended up buying it. Will be able to pick it up in two weeks, the wait is real.\\n\\n\\nThis is just my opinion of course and you don\\'t have to agree with me.\\n\\n\\nBefore anyone says that maybe small cars aren\\'t for me as a reason for me disliking the Fiesta, I currently have a 1999 Nissan Micra which is even smaller yet it doesn\\'t feel cramped and I enjoy sitting in it and driving it. Perhaps some might like the cramped feeling the Fiesta gives but it just wasn\\'t for me.\",4 years ago\\r\\nVolkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,Granny,4 years ago\\r\\nVolkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,I\\'ve gone from a VW Polo to a Fiesta ST and Fiesta much better to drive as i never stop smiling.,4 years ago\\r\\nVolkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,This Fiesta\\'s face looks a bit like a Grande Punto,4 years ago\\r\\nVolkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,\"Got myself a Fiesta Titanium.

All having the \\'must have\\' infotainment screen etc, the layout is the same as any other, just a different badge on the boot. Not all of us wants a car filled with tech either. Some drivers are actually older than 40 ! Can you believe that ? Of course, prices keep increasing with each new model and what we now have is most cars costing far too much in my opinion. The joke is, most are sold on PCP deals, nothing wrong with that but the average trade in time is 2 years on a 4 year deal, with only the dealers making money out of it as you trade it in for another new car on yet another PCP deal. I am doing one of two things. I got rid of the silly Audi because it was a waste of money, and I got a cheap new 3 cylinder thingy on a straight HP agreement, so eventually I will own it unlike the PCP buyers. Secondly, when I can afford to I intend to get a Subaru Forester which will last me for years and years as a tough long term car into retirement and beyond. Dont keep trading in.

In my country the Vignale does not come with all that kit (no sunroof or B&O as standard) and so the price difference from Titanium (which normally offers the best VFM option) was very small. The fact that I wanted navigation made the difference negligible, as the price of Titanium plus Navigation was almost equal to the price of Vignale and Vignale has Navigation as standard plus a lot of more extras. I believe Ford\\'s move to offer a Vignale edition is smart because there are a lot of customers who would pay a couple of thousand more to get a clearly \\'richer\\' version - if you intend to keep the car for more than a couple of years, in the longterm it is not a bad investment if it makes you feel better every time you get into your car. And in any case, if you want to go a little more luxurius in a small car, Fiesta is currently the only choice. Otherwise, the car is ok on the outside and very very nice on the inside, I totally disagree with negative opinions about the central touchscreen, it really adds to cars functionality and is very well built. Room is not as good as in competition but it is enough and if do not normally carry adults in the back this becomes irrelevant. Built quality is good and reliability is at least not bad - japanese and korean cars are more reliable but the quality of materials is clearly inferior, design is dull and handling is very compromising, so I still prefer european and the Fiesta has been a reliable car for such standards. In addition, Ford pricing is quite reasonable - on average any extra in the Fiesta is at least 20% cheaper than in their german competitors. And to comment on some other comments, if I may, yes, at the same price of a Vignale you can buy an A1, but an A1 with a minimum kit and essentially 8-years old technology, thus actually you will not go for an A1, you will go for a Polo (at least until the new A1 arrives next year). Ibiza I think is the main competitor, if you like the spartan interior (not cheap but more simple) and you do not care that much about equipment (at same price Fiesta is better equipped) then Ibiza is a great choice and a roomier one.\",6 years ago\\r\\nFord Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,\"It\\'s too bad these models dont see North American shores.. \\nI quite like this and would love to own a left hand drive one.\",6 years ago\\r\\nVolkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,Theres difference between model year and production year/1st registration,4 years ago\\r\\nWhy is it NOW or NEVER to buy a 2019 Ford Fiesta ST?,It really is disappointing!,4 years ago\\r\\nWhy is it NOW or NEVER to buy a 2019 Ford Fiesta ST?,Not sure how you can base the market size with just the comments.

I added BLIS, top stereo B&O, and the dealership gave me some extra gifts. I do a lot of km/miles and my average so far for 3k km or 1800 miles is 5.2l/100km or 54.3mpg. On the highway, if you won\\'t go above 60mph, you get around 3l/100km or 94mpg. The engine is superb. You don\\'t understand that it\\'s diesel. Instead, you get a good push from the torque of the engine on all the rev range. For next year, Ford hopefully will replace the 1.5TDCi with the new 1.5EcoBlue which is around 15% more powerful and economic, but they changed the method of measuring the CO2 and you get around 91+gr CO2 rated car. Mine is rated at 89gr. The new engine will have 4 valves on each cylinder instead of 2 of the current, off center crankshaft, precision diesel injection and more psi at the diesel pump. Sync3 is very good system, but spotify is removed since January. You can use Android Auto which is what I reccomend. Another update that may come in the Vignale version will be the led headlights, which are not available currently, but current automatic headlights are superb. In general, the car is ridiculous fuel efficient, and needs service every 30k km or once a year as the dealership told me, but I\\'ll change an oil filter and oil every 10k.\",6 years ago\\r\\nFord Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,7:00 BANGIN\\' & OLUFSEN ??,6 years ago\\r\\nFord Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,ST all the way imo :),6 years ago\\r\\nFord Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,\"Not much of an improvement over the old Fiesta, except the entertainment system which was needed.

Sometimes it was like driving in a green tunnel. The terrain is gently rolling and the roads not so twisty as curvy. The car felt very controllable, going quickly was easy. I had passengers so I could not go too fast but it was still fun to see how fast I could take corners with disturbing the wife.  Also I\\'ve noticed the Fords I\\'ve driven in Europe, even base models, are nicer than than their American counterparts. They drive better and the interiors are slightly nicer. This was especially true for the Escorts I\\'ve driven. In England 80\\'s and 90\\'s Escorts were kinda sporty and young \"\"chavs\"\" dudes who wore Burberry baseball caps drove them.

Compared to today\\'s small cars, driving an old Civic or Golf Mk1 or Fiesta Mk1 feels like driving naked. The fun thing about those early small  hatchbacks was that they were so light and nimble on city streets like the ones in San Francisco where I grew up. One late night, my friend and I drove his 1972 Honda Z600 through the pedestrian tunnel under the bleachers onto the mile long packed sand jogging track around the Polo fields in Golden Gate Park.  We were getting sideways on the turns with only the light of the moon to see by and Ozzy blasting on a boom box in the back seat. You could get away with more shenanigans back in the early 80\\'s. There were fewer cops and as long as you didn\\'t hang around one spot too long you could pull some fun stunts.\",4 years ago\\r\\nFORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,\"I actually own a mk3 feista and I\\'ve swapped a 4efte engine in it from a toyota starlet, thoughts?\",4 years ago\\r\\nFORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,Have one fiesta but it broke,4 years ago\\r\\nFORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,\"Somebody bring a duct tape, this guy in the audience is out of control ??\",4 years ago\\r\\nFORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,America hates black people and cool cars,4 years ago\\r\\nFORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,\"The reason we don\\xa1\\xaft likt big cars like Suv in Europe is because due the climate accord we get financially punished if we drive cars with highly consuming engines, thats why in Holland we pay \\x806 euro per gallon, like 6,66 dollars. ?????\\xa1\\xe1?\",4 years ago (edited)\\r\\nFORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,\"Never ever buy this car!!

Realistically someone who buys an Audi A1 or A3 (the type of car I assume Ford is trying to compete with) is not going to buy a Ford. They have a good thing with the Fiesta and Focus being the UK top 2 most popular cars of 2017, they should maintain that and forget about chasing the big germans with \\'luxury\\' versions of those cars. Personally, I think if they invested all that time and money into the other versions, they could have combated the practically issues with the cars, like the boot space and rear seat passenger comfort to bring it level with the Polo, but have the edge in driving experience to make it the all round better car.

Right up to the point that I got to poke around one in the metal. Incredibly disappointing as there\\'s far too many compromises that put it way behind rivals. Some are touched on here (the lack of space in both boot and rear seats is genuinely surprising considering what, say, a Honda Jazz brings to the table) but general build quality felt poor and, frankly, cheap. That touchscreen looks like something found on far cheaper rivals, the gloss black plastic was already scratched to hell on all three showroom cars and the door trims felt like they were from the 90\\'s! For a car that\\'s priced around the same as the VW Polo that\\'s really not good enough (think there\\'s around \\xa1\\xea400 difference between the Titanium recommended here and the equivalent SEL).  It may well be much better to drive but the vast bulk of my mileage is motorways and town driving. I suspect I\\'m not alone in this and would far rather sacrifice a little dynamic ability for refinement. Such a shame as they were on the right track with this car but it feels like they\\'re costing on the popularity of the model and know they don\\'t have to pull out all the stops. Good enough will do (and, I\\'m sure, is better for the bottom line). \\n\\nIn short if you\\'re thinking of this car by all means go ahead and audition it but I\\'d urge you to have a look at what else is available before putting down the deposit.\",6 years ago\\r\\nFord Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,That headrest lift at 1:47 was smooth as fuck,6 years ago (edited)\\r\\nFord Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,I saw the chev\\xa8\\xbatre,6 years ago\\r\\nFord Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,I can\\'t wait to see you review the Fiesta ST 2018 mate ????,6 years ago\\r\\nFord Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,\"To be fair, Polo and Ibiza aren\\'t really B segment cars anymore in terms of size.\",6 years ago\\r\\nFord Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,I read the title wrong the first time so I thought it said the Ford Tesla not the for Fiesta.????????????????,6 years ago\\r\\nFord Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,At last a car for grandma .,6 years ago\\r\\nFord Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,To be honest it\\'s a bad car overall from the looks of it so far.,6 years ago\\r\\nFord Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,Matt and 42 naaah,6 years ago\\r\\nFord Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,Fiesta is getting uglier ??????,6 years ago\\r\\nFord Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,yuck!

I almost never have people seating in the back and i\\'m 6\"\"5\\' (and I do sport a bit of a belly) so front roomyness is of utmost essence. And i do not like how cramped the old Mk7 fiesta feels. \\n\\nAbout the door closing feel. I never liked how compact Fords close their doors. It just feels like there\\'s no rubber to atenuate the hard latching of it. I do really like the new Dacias. They have a smooth and muffled \"\"plop\"\" to it that i truly appreciate. I had a peugeot 308 that had very satisfying door operation too.\\n\\nFor the looks and the peppy engine: Fiesta. For the economy and roomyness: Polo. What i\\'d actually buy? NEITHER!

And I\\'m going to tell you again that the Focus has a big boot and good legroom in the back. As does the Mondeo, as much as you like lying again. Check Matt\\'s Mondeo review and you\\'ll see the legroom and boot are more than adequate.  \\nOnce again, I invite you to inform yourself. The Fiesta is exactly what it needed to be.

The 2 cars in this video actually seem like cars best avoided if you are looking for decent value and low running costs. I personally would never consider spending close to \\xa1\\xea20k on cars like these. Of the 2 I\\'d choose the Polo though because of the Ford\\'s faster depreciation in the UK and also seems a lot of problems with Ford Eco-boost engines that is quite off-putting. I would also point out that having a nice dashboard and doors that make a pleasing solid noise when closed is not a true indicator of build quality. A car that is made to tight tolerances and has fantastic long term reliability not just within the warranty period is a true sign of fantastic build quality and something the Japanese generally do best hence why the cost of owning such cars is often much more lower than owning German cars nowadays.\",5 years ago\\r\\nVolkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,VWs are not reliable!!!!!,5 years ago\\r\\nVolkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,\"I really wish Matt would stop trying to be funny in these reviews.

Buy your 2010-2020 fiesta or focus in a manual! It does matter what model it is. The automatic transmissions built in fiestas and focuses were built with clutches not torque converters. In simple terms the car\\xa1\\xafs computer will guess which gear to select, disconnect the transmission from the engine, switch gears, reconnect the transmission with the engine, and then it prays to god that you aren\\xa1\\xaft slowing down or going up a hill because that\\xa1\\xafs when gears start to get  grind . You can notice this when your slowing driving walking speed because you\\xa1\\xafll feel a chattering effect. A Ford dealership had to  replace two transmissions and on a separate occasion they had do a transmission re-programming for my gf.  I told her to return the car since we only drove it for 28,000 miles. Luckily the dealership took it back and we were going to take the money and look at suvs but then I also remembered that ford doesn\\xa1\\xaft know how to make proper transfer cases. The real reason why fiestas are being pulled is because of a drunk engineer that thought it was a good idea to mix manual and automatic parts together. The 2010-2020 focuses have the same problems but they have been in the American market for decades so they have a reputation but if Ford keeps putting these type of transmissions in focuses they will also get pulled from the production line. It\\xa1\\xafs not just one car btw. I always here other people also  bitching and moaning about how their focus/fiesta/and (sometimes) fusion have these crappy transmissions.\",4 years ago\\r\\nFORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,Would you consider doing an Up to Speed on the Ford Taurus SHO?

The cars are just too different.  \\n\\nPracticality isn\\'t subjective, you\\'re right - but not everybody cares about it. I don\\'t for example, I\\'m alone or have +1 passenger in my car 99% of the time while my boot is either empty or has a rucksack in it because I travel light. I\\'m much more interested in how fun a car is.  \\n\\nOn top of that, the Polo is plain bigger - it\\'s stretching the limits of the Supermini class by being bigger than a MK4 Golf. It\\'s almost as big as a MK7 Golf, Mat even made the initial Polo review with the headline \\'Do you really need a Golf?\\'.  \\n\\nMy point is that picking a winner isn\\'t so easy when comparing these cars because of the size difference. Not only that, but it\\'s also about comfort vs sportiness. Imo it\\'s odd that Mat even picked a winner instead of saying something like \\'you want fun, get Fiesta - you want practicality, get Polo\\'.\",5 years ago\\r\\nVolkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,Maybe it\\xa1\\xafs cos VAG makes good cars...?,5 years ago\\r\\nVolkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,Because carwow seems to still reside in reality and not jump on the anti-german bandwagon?,5 years ago (edited)\\r\\nVolkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,\"Plain bigger, 15mm?\\nLength: POLO - 4053mm, FIESTA - 4040mm\\nWidth: POLO - 1751mm, FIESTA - 1735mm\\nHeight: POLO - 1446mm, Fiesta - 1476mm\\n\\nMaybe is just that they did a better job with it?\",5 years ago\\r\\nVolkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,\"If your spending \\xa1\\xea18k on a car I\\'ll guarantee you\\'ll get more for your money from Ford than VW.

Ibiza looks sharper and quality not that much worse. I had one as courtesy car and enjoyed it. Was sad to give it back. I like the destinctive sound of the little 1 litre 3 cylinder. Much more interesting than a 4 and smoother at higher revs. 4s get harsh when revved. 3s get loud but not unpleasant. I\\'d spec my Ibiza quite highly as the base model I had looked cheap inside as everything was grey. Not the case in models further up the range.

The early S tronic gearboxes in Audis weren\\'t fantastic because they failed at around 100k miles but with a ford I don\\'t think you expect anything to last that long do you? \\nThe DSG gearboxes are pretty bulletproof.\\nThe beetle was a bare bones economy car yes... 70years ago, and it\\'s the only car you still see on the road except a camper van (also VW). \\nI don\\'t think anyone treat VW as a premium badge because it\\'s not one.  There are plenty of cars that are, but what VW does have in common with those brands (and very very commonly beats them in terms of) is resale value because people know that the second and third owner can expect the same reliability that the first did. \\nThat said there are plenty of good cheaper options, like the Skoda and Seat, or even an Up! but the only non VAG car that I think can match VAG\\'s quality is possibly Honda but they\\'ve done everything they can to make their cars flamboyant and modern but in doing so making them age terribly, which is a shame. \\nFrench alternatives are pretty and drive well, I like the DS3 and the 209 but theyre  just not going to last or retain even 50% of their value in the first 3yrs.\",5 years ago\\r\\nVolkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,\"Ed Gimson Hello Toyota dealer, Lexus is compared with Audi, not VW, Skoda or Seat.

In the rear view mirror nothing in sight. Streets are empty.  I\\'ll even help you out and call it rainy. Green arrow appears. You would have had to have a running start at the light to do your Lift-Off oversteer. From a dead stop how are you going to bring the backend out besides having McDonald\\'s trays and the e-brake pulled ? With front-engine rear-drive, you don\\'t even have to pop the clutch. As you go into the turn just hit the pedal on the right and fun begins. I don\\'t want to wait halfway down the street and hope the light turns green so I can fly in and Lift-Off oversteer. And then what if you get a bunch of understeer. you have to have the proper suspension in the proper front wheel drive car to do it. you can take any rear wheel drive and kick it out.\",4 years ago\\r\\nFORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,\"?@shona5512?
