Change the oil twice as frequently as recommended...it will save you thousands in timing chain repairs.  The thermostat should be changed every 50-60k miles.  Plan on it failing around that point. Also the timing chain should be changed out at around the 100-110K miles point (if you change the oil frequently). Do the thermostat with the timing chain replacement, together. Lastly, as the N14 and N18 engines are DFI, be sure to use higher octane fuels.  I prefer to run with premium (98-100), to minimize carbon build-up at the intake, over time. For these engines, an aftermarket oil catch can will also help minimize carbon build-up at the intake.<br><br>If you buy used, make sure to have the car checked out by a qualified professional and insist on seeing the maintenance records. The frequency of oil changes (full synthetics) being a key indicator as to the health of the engine.<br><br>Other than that...I find the Mini to be a reliable car that is extremely nimble and fun to drive.

Unlike most cars, it allows for the water pump to be disengaged when not in use (so that the car is using energy powering a pump unnecessarily).

I think that Mini is generally marketed to a crowd who want something fun, cute and relatively peppy, which being fuel efficient.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJaKMANiZdI,JR Car Reviews,2024-03-28T15:49:01Z,36646,"Excellent review! Thanks for that. There&#39;s a lot I really like about the F66, but there are some things that I think are real issues for me: One, the rear of the car. I don&#39;t care for the tail lights, the black trim, and the concavity under that trim piece. Not only do these details feel out of place on the car (i.e. they aren&#39;t harmonious with the design), they&#39;re not characteristic MINI design details. I&#39;m also wondering whose idea it was to hide the exhaust on a sporty hot hatch...that decision will never make any sense to me. Two, the rose gold trim (everywhere). I think my not-quite-young-anymore mom would love it, but it&#39;s not a finish I want on my car. To me, it makes the car look like a handbag with wheels. Three, the interior CMF (color, materials and finishes). I love the physical design of the interior. I get the references to the original MINI, and for me it all works...other than all of the conflicting patterns and colors. That clean, simple interior works best when the designers allow it to stand on its own. I&#39;ve seen too many of these F66 cars, and the J01, with busy interiors. I certainly don&#39;t want blue MINI badges in a red car, for example. I also don&#39;t want every color and pattern under the sun on my seats. MINI need to back off of the CMF overload and let the interior physical design be the star...it can stand on its own. The F56 was criticized for having unnecessarily busy geometry (outside and inside), but the new F66 and J01 are still busy; they just do busy in a different way. Overall, I really like this car...I feel like it&#39;s 90% there. I&#39;m anxious to see how MINI &quot;fix&quot; the rear of the car, and how long it takes them to do so.",2024-04-16T01:55:44Z,excellent review thanks lot really like f thing think real issue one rear car care tail light black trim concavity trim piece detail feel place car e harmonious design characteristic mini design detail also wondering whose idea hide exhaust sporty hot hatch decision never make sense two rose gold trim everywhere think quite young anymore mom would love finish want car make car look like handbag wheel three interior cmf color material finish love physical design interior get reference original mini work conflicting pattern color clean simple interior work best designer allow stand seen many f car j busy interior certainly want blue mini badge red car example also want every color pattern sun seat mini need back cmf overload let interior physical design star stand f criticized unnecessarily busy geometry outside inside new f j still busy busy different way overall really like car feel like anxious see mini fix rear car long take,excellent review thanks lot really like f thing think real issue one rear car care tail light black trim concavity trim piece detail feel place car e harmonious design characteristic mini design detail also wondering whose idea hide exhaust sporty hot hatch decision never make sense two rose gold trim everywhere think quite young anymore mom would love finish want car make car look like handbag wheel three interior cmf color material finish love physical design interior get reference original mini work conflicting pattern color clean simple interior work best designer allow stand seen many f car j busy interior certainly want blue mini badge red car example also want every color pattern sun seat mini need back cmf overload let interior physical design star stand f criticized unnecessarily busy geometry outside inside new f j still busy busy different way overall really like car feel like anxious see mini fix rear car long take

I feel a little like, since BMW were gifted the single valuable bit of Rover group they wanted - jilting Honda unpleasantly in the process - it‚Äôs like they‚Äôve gradually been ‚Äòprocessing‚Äô what was a very natural, organic product.  Here we are, well over 2 decades on, and it‚Äôs lost almost all its flavour.  Just imho.  I mean, who knows what Honda would have done, but this is literally a Mini in name only.  Maybe that works, for some people.  I don‚Äôt disparage electric cars in general, not being a fan of changing gears when the car can do it for me, they have a natural advantage to me.  I only know this: if EVs were the norm since 1950 say, to present-day, nobody would be able to convince a boardroom to buy or drive an ICE design.  It‚Äôs inconceivable, due to the environmental catastrophe alone.  But, noise, invisible toxins, etc etc, that‚Äôd blow it out the water anyway.  And that, is with today‚Äôs rather wimpish batteries.  <br><br>Breakthrough or not, the batteries are slowly improving anyway.  It‚Äôs where we‚Äôre headed, I think the war is already over, won &amp; lost, but during the transition, I have no beef with other motive power units, and don‚Äôt think ordinary people ought to be punished financially for keeping their purchased vehicle for a decent length of time.  I drive an old Prius, and previously did indeed scoff.  I literally bought it based on just two main parameters: One, it cannot have the same lousy fragile automatic transmission, all the other used cars I bought have;  Two, I cannot afford enough battery power to make the car get really hot inside the cabin, after a cold or wet winter‚Äôs walk in the hills.  Those two things, swung the purchase.  EVs overcome the first also, but are squarely a problem for the second because nothing is much better as a boiler than a diesel or petrol/gas combustion engine.  A great boiler is 93% efficient, and any old ICE is 80% efficient as a heat producer.  We tend to forget only 20% gets anywhere near turning a shaft.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the British market received numerous &quot;special editions&quot; of the Mini, which shifted the car from a mass-market item into a fashionable icon because of the Retro design understanding. And since the day Mini came out with new Countryman and the new Mini S/SE. Even the 2023 Mini cooper SE has the characteristic tounches everywhere exterior and interior! KEEP READƒ∞NG DOWN BELOW. !!!<br><br>My objective thoughts and pros-cons list :<br>Pros:<br>1- Bigger battery; had to be improved because even cars like peugeot 208e-500e had bigger batteries than the previous generation Mini Cooper SE. <br><br>2- The chassis is lengthened; A longer chassis can provide more spacious interior and increases performance.<br><br>3- Growth of mirrors; I think it&#39;s counter-design, considering the iconic circular mirrors and iconic design language. However, for someone who is not very tall, larger and rectangular mirrors can be considered functional as they can minimize blind spots.<br><br>4- More options on Customization the Mini. Also great to see John Cooper Works exterior body kit so smooth...<br><br>5- More horse power means better perfomance! Great to see!<br><br>CONS; God! I&#39;m furious and dissapointed the are too many of them! (OBJECTIVELY)<br>1- The black plastic artch trim has gone? Seriously? Those places especially if you live in cities will get tremendous amounts of small damages from other car doors and small physical contacts. Also where is the iconic design?<br><br>2- The taillights? What the hack you guys were thinking? The physical≈ü design had never changed since 1990&#39;s and you guys not only changed the shape, also ABOLISHED the Union jack Great Britan flag and instead put a triangular cheap material chinese looking lights.<br><br>3- ƒ∞nterior: The new generation automobile industry finds it right to express interior design in the most extreme way possible. But if we look at the cars that have reached the timeless design language. No matter what and what, you will not come across such a disgraceful interior design. The reason? The reason is that everywhere inside is made of a single material and they are trying to look as if it is a brand like Tesla. No my friend, this huge screen does not reflect the 1959 Central Speedo screen. There may be people who like it, but if everything is being completely electronic on a single screen, including the air conditioning controls, the car will be more anti-userfriendly and you will understand how useless it is after using it for a week. Also I don&#39;t think anyone has to like this stupidly designed &quot;futuristic&quot; steering wheel.<br><br>4- Interior buttons used to make you feel like you&#39;re in a spaceship or an airplane. This swisting and one-screen-everything buttons are definitely less charismatic than previous Mini&#39;s. More cheap material plastics being used and carpets everywhere making it like its only one piece carpet. Love to see and feels of the better quality materials on my Cooper SE!

My Coop was off the road for a month waiting for a part after a display failure ( Curtesy 5 series for the duration) Rattle that still today remain that they could never find but could hear. They found the fuse box didn‚Äôt have screws so rattled, wiring went across the dash underneath that shouldn‚Äôt that rattled on a central vent under the windscreen.

I drive a 450 bhp HSV Track Ed, with 570nm, rear drive, 6 piston 390mm AP racing brakes. Yep it‚Äôs a fantastic car, you won‚Äôt see one as they only made 150, mine is number 90. HSV spent a considerable amount of time tuning the suspension. So yep, not only does the car stop and accelerate to 100 in 4.5 seconds. It‚Äôs rear wheel drive and handles brilliantly, both on the road and on the track. Every time I drive it, I hold the alcantara steering wheel, listen to the bimodal, exhaust burble in sport and I grin, love that car! At the time the reviewers gave it 9.5/10 &amp; I agree. After 40 years of car experience including 3 years as a passenger in a new 1973 BMW 3.0 si, 3 years in a brand new manual Porsche 928, 3 years in a 733i as passenger and driver, 10 years and 200,000 owning a 735i Sport V8, I‚Äôve owned 10 Alfas and spent 5 years selling Peugeot‚Äôs. I‚Äôve driven many many cars that I don‚Äôt own. Having said that 5 years of driving my wife‚Äôs Cooper S. What do I think? First thing, change the tyres to Michelin PS4‚Äôs, secondly the brake pads to ATE Ceramic‚Ä¶.then you have a car that‚Äôs set up well. Personally I don‚Äôt think there is a requirement for active suspension. The standard set up is great, the only time I‚Äôve ever heard rattles is it there is something loose in the car, for instance my sun glasses case did not have the press stud closed and rattled! It‚Äôs not the car, it‚Äôs your belongings! The Sport mode makes a big difference, much faster shifts from the DSG and it automatically turns off the stop start, you also hear more of the exhaust. However if I really want to drive it hard, I push the leaver to the left and drive the car manually with the paddle shifts. It‚Äôs an nicely torque endowed little engine and always feels ready to go. When you need to get on it, it goes‚Ä¶hard. I smile driving this car and regularly. Sorry don‚Äôt agree about the Mini magic, I think this current Mini is the best Mini by a mile! My wife and I love it and for what we paid, we think it‚Äôs a bargain! Nothing better than cruising in summer either, roof open, Harmon Kardon cranking, sun glasses on, you shouldn‚Äôt be able to have so much fun, then pull into the a tight car park at the local Malvern Central in our case and we can park with ease‚Ä¶.do our shopping then head back out for the fun trip home. Our daughter often tells us to take the long way home! We feel very fortunate to own and drive the cars we do!

It took the front end off the Mini but she walked away without a scratch.

The R53 and R56 S/JCW were so much fun to drive. The F56 cannot even touch the old models&#39; excitement, exhaust note, or quirkiness. The B48 engine also is a bore compared to the old N18. The old 1.6T pulled hard from idle to redline, whereas the B48 feels flat above 5000rpm and BMW has put their horrible warble through the stereo to cover up the actual engine note. It&#39;s also really strange that in 2021 you cannot get blindspot monitoring, cross traffic detection, lane keeping assist, etc. They also got rid of the real adaptive dampers. BOO!

At least through 2021 all models with the manual did, including the Cooper model. My 2019 does and there‚Äôs no way to turn it on/off unless you turn off all the traction and stability aids (in which case the auto rev matching is off). Not sure if MINI made changes with the LCI2 in 2022, however.<br><br>Anyway, the Cooper model is very underrated. It‚Äôs lighter than the 4-cylinder Cooper S model, with most of the weight savings over the front axle which is always good for turn-in and handling feel. And the 3-cylinder has a more unique exhaust note than the 4-cylinder, too (4-cylinders are a dime a dozen in the car market). With some aftermarket finessing of the intake, exhaust, and ECU, my 3-cylinder MINI is making quite a bit more power than it did stock and quite a few people have complemented the sound. I also like being the underdog üòà The only thing I really don‚Äôt like about the Cooper is the manual transmission.  It‚Äôs innocuous enough in general (and is very closely related to the 6-speed manual in the Cooper S model), but it has really tall gearing, unusually tall gearing. It‚Äôs clearly geared toward fuel economy. The 6-speed manual in the Cooper S has much more closely spaced gearing. <br><br>Going on 6 years since I bought my 2019 Cooper and the car has been a blast and has not had a single problem in all that time, just regular maintenance as recommended by MINI USA.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGAzpf3iArs,Top Gear,2024-05-07T22:00:27Z,209854,"I hope some real Top Gear guy reads this detailed comment. Many years of experience with Mini cars and as a Cooper SE 2023 owner, here&#39;s my comments and pros-cons list.<br>I will have to start with negatives because fairly, they ruined the iconic-retro design of their own. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the British market received numerous &quot;special editions&quot; of the Mini, which shifted the car from a mass-market item into a fashionable icon because of the Retro design understanding. And since the day Mini came out with new Countryman and the new Mini S/SE. Even the 2023 Mini cooper SE has the characteristic tounches everywhere exterior and interior! KEEP READƒ∞NG DOWN BELOW. !!!<br><br>My objective thoughts and pros-cons list :<br>Pros:<br>1- Bigger battery; had to be improved because even cars like peugeot 208e-500e had bigger batteries than the previous generation Mini Cooper SE. <br><br>2- The chassis is lengthened; A longer chassis can provide more spacious interior and increases performance.<br><br>3- Growth of mirrors; I think it&#39;s counter-design, considering the iconic circular mirrors and iconic design language. However, for someone who is not very tall, larger and rectangular mirrors can be considered functional as they can minimize blind spots.<br><br>4- More options on Customization the Mini. Also great to see John Cooper Works exterior body kit so smooth...<br><br>5- More horse power means better perfomance! Great to see!<br><br>6- More head room in the back is good, but there&#39;s a trick that they removed the second sunroof from the back and extended the front sunroof to have more space for the back seat passengers. <br><br>CONS; God! I&#39;m furious and dissapointed the are too many of them! (OBJECTIVELY)<br>1- The black plastic artch trim has gone? Seriously? Those places especially if you live in cities will get tremendous amounts of small damages from other car doors and small physical contacts. Also where is the iconic design?<br><br>2- The taillights? What the hack you guys were thinking? The physical≈ü design had never changed since 1990&#39;s and you guys not only changed the shape, also ABOLISHED the Union jack Great Britan flag and instead put a triangular cheap material chinese looking lights.<br><br>3- ƒ∞nterior: The new generation automobile industry finds it right to express interior design in the most extreme way possible. But if we look at the cars that have reached the timeless design language. No matter what and what, you will not come across such a disgraceful interior design. The reason? The reason is that everywhere inside is made of a single material and they are trying to look as if it is a brand like Tesla. No my friend, this huge screen does not reflect the 1959 Central Speedo screen. There may be people who like it, but if everything is being completely electronic on a single screen, including the air conditioning controls, the car will be more anti-userfriendly and you will understand how useless it is after using it for a week. Also I don&#39;t think anyone has to like this stupidly designed &quot;futuristic&quot; steering wheel.<br><br>4- Interior buttons used to make you feel like you&#39;re in a spaceship or an airplane. This swisting and one-screen-everything buttons are definitely less charismatic than previous Mini&#39;s. More cheap material plastics being used and carpets everywhere making it like its only one piece carpet. Love to see and feels of the better quality materials on my Cooper SE! I love them.<br><br><br>5- WHERE IS THE SCOOP? I CAN&#39;T SEE. <br><br>I would be happier if I was able to see Mini brand not being gay and try to shine, wanting to be more popular, not following the stupid path started by other brands... if if if if....

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is604WXGvcI,Chops Garage,2021-08-24T18:00:14Z,610292,"The manufacturer may state the timing chain and the automatic transmission&#39;s lifetime (sealed) fluid may not need changing if maintenance intervals are respected.  However, with the N14 /N18, I would humbly disagree.  The timing chain, ESPECIALLY with the manufacturer recommended oil changes (every 10K miles), will most likely need a change at 50,000~70,000 Miles.  In fact, the best way to extend the timing chain life is to increase the oil change frequency to every 5,000 miles. Unfortunately, on a used car...it&#39;s very difficult to verify the higher frequency of oil changes unless the maintenance history has been meticulously kept.  I have an 11.2007 R55 S with the N14...and had the timing chain replaced (full kit) at 85,000 miles on the odometer...for around CHF2200...four years ago. I change the oil &amp; filter myself every 5000 miles with 5W30 full synthetic. The car takes 4.2L...and I check the oil dipstick after every other fill-up of the gas tank. I keep a 1L bottle of oil in the car at all times...as it needs a 0.4L top off after every 750 miles. I try to keep levels on the high side of the dipstick measure. Bottom line...if you want that mini to last, CHECK and CHANGE the oil at 2x the manufacturer&#39;s recommended frequency.  This is the one specific maintenance area where you need to be on-top of the situation with any N14/N18 Mini. Especially the N14.<br>As for the automatic (steptronic) transmission....DRAIN and REPLACE (do NOT flush) the fluid every 50,000 miles.<br>Lastly, I do use 6 oz&#39;s of SEAFOAM on the dirty side of the vacuum return hose from the N14 valve cover (upper left corner of the valve cover when facing the car) every 6 months. With a warm engine, I take a coffee-sized paper cup of SeaFoam, with my thumb over the removed vacuum hose, and slowly let the vacuum pull SeaFoam from the cup as I carefully tilt the cup (so as not to stall the engine...avoiding a vapor lock). I prefer to have someone in the car keeping the engine rev at 2000rpm while adding the SeaFoam.  I then shutoff the car and let the SeaFoam sit in the air intake and above the valves for 0.5 hours. Thereafter, I run the car at 4K rpm for 5 minutes to clean out the excess carbon (until the smoke clears, so to speak). This is necessary due to the older Direct Fuel Injection system whereby carbon builds up around the valve tops.  SeaFoam (or similar cleaners) does a good job of lessening the carbon build up. Not sure if this will avoid an expensive cleaning by a certified tech (with crushed walnut blasting)...but at least it extends the interval for said maintenance.<br>IMO, Mini&#39;s are a lot of fun to drive...sportive and good looking too!  However, GEN2&#39;s are a terrible first car, unless that young driver has a family member (e.g., dad) that keeps track of the maintenance. Also, Mini S&#39;s and JCW&#39;s are probably not the best cars for young drivers...too much power in the hands of inexperienced drivers, IMO. Had a business colleague who&#39;s young brother-in-law was given a new Mini Cooper S upon graduation from university.

Last car we bought from a dealership had an intermittent electrical problem that we&#39;re like 98.5% certain that the dealer knew about but didn&#39;t tell us about. The reason why we suspect they knew is because once the problem showed up and we started digging into it we noticed that the the wiring harness to the ECU was sliced open and the ECU connector was packed full of copper grease. I ended up having to diagnose and troubleshoot it myself because our mechanic thought it would be too expensive to have done professionally and recommended that we scrapped the car. Can&#39;t say i wouldn&#39;t have wanted to know about that problem beforehand, and we definitely wouldn&#39;t have paid what we did for the car if we&#39;d known. Certainly would have beat being lied to and told that the car was in great condition and that it had been meticulously looked after by the previous owner.<br><br>So sure, if we&#39;re talking about completely car-illiterate people wanting to be told that a used car is basically never going to have to be repaired and never require any maintainence, then i can sort of see your argument. But if we&#39;re talking about dealers hiding and lying about faults in cars and then trying to gouge their customers for as much money as possible, then no. I can guarantee that absolutely nobody who&#39;s in the business of buying used cars wants that.

They don&#39;t often care how much the purchase price is and they don&#39;t check if it&#39;s stolen or has genuine service history or mileage. They see it as a mode of transport and like the shiny ones best. Once purchased they don&#39;t want to spend a penny on maintenance and upkeep. I remember a chap I worked with traded in his 2 year old mini cooper s convertible because the brakes were making a noise. All it needed was a new set of pads. He never serviced it during his entire time of ownership either. He spent many times more buying a new car and trading in his old one than the maintenance costs. He then complained how unreliable his old car was. I budget repairs on my car every year. It&#39;s 10 years old so maintenance is to be expected and as a consequence it runs sweet as a nut :),2021-08-24T19:43:39Z,general public foolish look buy car often care much purchase price check stolen genuine service history mileage see mode transport like shiny one best purchased want spend penny maintenance upkeep remember chap worked traded year old mini cooper convertible brake making noise needed new set pad never serviced entire time ownership either spent many time buying new car trading old one maintenance cost complained unreliable old car budget repair car every year year old maintenance expected consequence run sweet nut,general public foolish look buy car often care much purchase price check stolen genuine service history mileage see mode transport like shiny one best purchased want spend penny maintenance upkeep remember chap worked traded year old mini cooper convertible brake making noise needed new set pad never serviced entire time ownership either spent many time buying new car trading old one maintenance cost complained unreliable old car budget repair car every year year old maintenance expected consequence run sweet nut

I have driven a countryman (only a Cooper) as a lone car, and I was quite impressed generally.<br>I was also offered a test drive in a JCW countryman when I ordered my Clubbie as they didn‚Äôt have one of those to test, but I declined.<br>I knew how special the new JCW Clubbie was going to be and I certainly wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The extra space in the Clubbie compared to my previous hatch is like a barn to me and very useful so I‚Äôm more than happy.<br>As previously mentioned somewhere, I have the adaptive dampers on mine and on normal setting they give a ready good ride. In sports mode they stiffen up to give a firmer ride but this is still very comfortable unless you hit a potholed road at town speeds.<br>I drive from 30 miles Brighton to Chichester and back every day to and from work. In the mornings it‚Äôs usually mid mode from the trip with the occasional blast in sport mode. Coming home 90`% of the time it‚Äôs in sports mode with dynamic traction switched onüòú, easily drivable in town and all the way home. Quite often my route changes to go through Amberley, Storrington , Steyning and down past the cement works to the flyover. I love my Clubbie ü§ó<br>The only thing that is frustrating my is the fitting of a rear dashcam. Easy on the hatchbacks but I cannot seem to find the best way of installing one on the Clubbie.<br>The barn doors swing away from the body as they open so it‚Äôs not easy to route the cables.<br>How about looking into this and doing a feature just for me-it would really help if I could find a solution (beg, beg, grovel..etc).<br>Love your vids mate, always a pleasure to watch.....(that‚Äôs another grovel).üòÇüëç",2021-05-01T06:47:20Z,interesting pete another comprehensive review driven countryman cooper lone car quite impressed generally also offered test drive jcw countryman ordered clubbie one test declined knew special new jcw clubbie going certainly disappointed extra space clubbie compared previous hatch like barn useful happy previously mentioned somewhere adaptive damper mine normal setting give ready good ride sport mode stiffen give firmer ride still comfortable unless hit potholed road town speed drive mile brighton chichester back every day work morning usually mid mode trip occasional blast sport mode coming home time sport mode dynamic traction switched easily drivable town way home quite often route change go amberley storrington steyning past cement work flyover love clubbie thing frustrating fitting rear dashcam easy hatchback seem find best way installing one clubbie barn door swing away body open easy route cable looking feature would really help could find solution beg beg grovel etc love vids mate always pleasure watch another grovel,interesting pete another comprehensive review driven countryman cooper lone car quite impressed generally also offered test drive jcw countryman ordered clubbie one test declined knew special new jcw clubbie going certainly disappointed extra space clubbie compared previous hatch like barn useful happy previously mentioned somewhere adaptive damper mine normal setting give ready good ride sport mode stiffen give firmer ride still comfortable unless hit potholed road town speed drive mile brighton chichester back every day work morning usually mid mode trip occasional blast sport mode coming home time sport mode dynamic traction switched winking face tongue easily drivable town way home quite often route change go amberley storrington steyning past cement work flyover love clubbie smiling face open hand thing frustrating fitting rear dashcam easy hatchback seem find best way installing one clubbie barn door swing away body open easy route cable looking feature would really help could find solution beg beg grovel etc love vids mate always pleasure watch another grovel face tear joy thumb

No more , no less !<br>2) Rear room: You are the problem, not the cars ! You don&#39;t buy a Mini to haul people. Minis are made to haul groceries and other &quot;small stuff&quot;.<br>3) Boot: Barn doors win all the time. I hate garage doors on any vehicle ! But, the best has to be tail gates (like on pick-ups) !<br>4) You don&#39;t buy a Mini to haul a bicycle because bicycles are bigger ! With an adequate rear rack on the bicycle your could haul the Mini on the back of the bicycle !<br>5) If you require the additional purchase of a roof box (Give away !) The car is too small !<br>6) Driving position: The number one shock ! You&#39;re sitting on the wrong side of the car ! ! You would be in heaven if you get a Ferrari F2004 ! It&#39;s seating position is pretty low.<br>7) Ride quality: Really ? We are talking about a Mini are we not ? A lorry has a better ride quality for goodness sake ! Now back to my Flex, that is ride quality. I mean it, try it and you&#39;ll be blown away ! (By the way, did I mention that you are seating on the wrong side of the car !) MY GOOD LORD ! YOU&#39;RE EVEN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD ! ! ! I too had 255/45R20 on my Ford and they are beautiful to look at as with the Minis but I changed for 235/60R18 to get some road comfort ! A wheel rim with a smidge of rubber does not equate comfort ! <br>8) Engine/Exhaust noise: Any one of these are a problem.....return the car promptly to your dealer ! We are in 2021, cars are not supposed to make noise ! I tell you, get a Ferrari F2004, it screams !<br>9) 0-60-0: How does this work out in downtown London ? I thought so ! Just to make things even, my Ford Flex (290 hp) 4700 lbs curb weight 0-60 in 7.7 sec ! (Had I the Turbo oooohhh ! ) It could scream 0-60 in 5.9 sec ! And we are hauling 4,800 lbs curb weight !<br>10) I get the feeling you like go-carts.......oh, you do ! (I&#39;m watching the video and pause as I write) !<br>11) As a second errand getter I&#39;d love a Mini....they are cute and fun little car.<br>12) Great content, love the videos !

Charge Cars collapsed into administration on May 31 without a single one of its cars reaching customers. The automotive industry issued renewed pleas for electric car purchase incentives after new figures showed a decline in the vehicles&#39; market share. Some 15.2% of new cars registered in March were pure electrics, down from 16.2% during the same month last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The survey of over 300,000 vehicles found electric models suffer 79% more maintenance problems than gas-powered cars. Meanwhile, plug-in hybrids fared even worse  with a concerning 146% more issues reported by drivers. <br><br>Volvo XC40 catches fire and a child was rescued in a recent fire involving a brand new Volvo XC40 hybrid and raises concerns about electric car safety. The driver, who just received the car, managed to rescue his granddaughter before it exploded In a daring rescue, a motorist sustained severe burns pulling his 19-month-old granddaughter from the back seat as his brand-new hybrid car went up in flames and exploded. Seeing smoke, David Butler, a retired engineer at 67, sprang into action. His wife Anne, also 67, had turned back to witness the horror. The rear seat, where their toddler sat in a baby seat, was engulfed in flames, intense &quot;as if someone had poured petrol on a barbecue.&quot; With a screeching halt, Butler scrambled to reach his granddaughter, Lilly. Much to his chagrin, the rear door of their Volvo XC40, which could run on both gasoline and electric power, refused to budge.Undeterred by the smoke and flames, he clambered back into the front seat and, with a determined reach, managed to unbuckle and free his granddaughter. &quot;Fortunately, I managed to feel for the seat release and dragged her out of the car,&quot; he said in a¬†Facebook post. &quot;As I did this, the hybrid battery exploded, igniting the fuel tank and filling the car with flames.

EVs initially had some tax incentives for being &quot;green&quot; (varies by state). But they were higher priced as a new technology, high cost of manufacturing, expensive batteries etc. Then state governments realized they were loosing a decent bit of bag from taxes at the fuel pump.<br><br>Fast forward a few years, and now manufacturing is a bit more dialed in, battery tech has become more efficient and pricing for batteries has gone down. But the governments imposed sly tax slaps on EV&#39;s to recover the revenue lost from fuel purchases. Ironically, the standard half ton pick-up (i.e. Ford F150, Chevy Silverado 1500 etc.) have become one of the most popular vehicles here, and price to power/price to weight of material sold is quite low (relative to modern pricing. Some of these top model trucks/SUVs go beyond $100k which is ludicrous) <br><br>Depending on the state, there is a bit of a tax incentive on makers/dealers to sell vehicles below 25 mph because it increases fuel sales. Add-on that in many agricultural states (I live in Florida, for example) these standard pick-ups are categorized as a tool to assist in agricultural economy and are then incentivized even more. They are also socially/ideologically considered safer, so insurance is often less, and these models are popular so parts are readily available. etc. etc. etc.<br><br>Never owned an EV. The areas I live in are not perfectly fit for it in my use case. So I am not sure what taxes are put on electricity purchases at charging stations. I would imagine it&#39;s still a commodity when used as vehicle power. But maybe it&#39;s considered a utility purchase? I don&#39;t see why they wouldn&#39;t be able to tax charging stations like fuel pumps to at least make the vehicle value more appealing.",2024-07-16T13:04:51Z,speak euro market state well known issue pricing ev initially tax incentive green varies state higher priced new technology high cost manufacturing expensive battery etc state government realized loosing decent bit bag tax fuel pump fast forward year manufacturing bit dialed battery tech become efficient pricing battery gone government imposed sly tax slap ev recover revenue lost fuel purchase ironically standard half ton pick e ford f chevy silverado etc become one popular vehicle price power price weight material sold quite low relative modern pricing top model truck suv go beyond k ludicrous depending state bit tax incentive maker dealer sell vehicle mph increase fuel sale add many agricultural state live florida example standard pick ups categorized tool assist agricultural economy incentivized even also socially ideologically considered safer insurance often le model popular part readily available etc etc etc never owned ev area live perfectly fit use case sure tax put electricity purchase charging station would imagine still commodity used vehicle power maybe considered utility purchase see able tax charging station like fuel pump least make vehicle value appealing,speak euro market state well known issue pricing ev initially tax incentive green varies state higher priced new technology high cost manufacturing expensive battery etc state government realized loosing decent bit bag tax fuel pump fast forward year manufacturing bit dialed battery tech become efficient pricing battery gone government imposed sly tax slap ev recover revenue lost fuel purchase ironically standard half ton pick e ford f chevy silverado etc become one popular vehicle price power price weight material sold quite low relative modern pricing top model truck suv go beyond k ludicrous depending state bit tax incentive maker dealer sell vehicle mph increase fuel sale add many agricultural state live florida example standard pick ups categorized tool assist agricultural economy incentivized even also socially ideologically considered safer insurance often le model popular part readily available etc etc etc never owned ev area live perfectly fit use case sure tax put electricity purchase charging station would imagine still commodity used vehicle power maybe considered utility purchase see able tax charging station like fuel pump least make vehicle value appealing

Few modern ground-up EVs are as efficient - I got 4.3mi/kWh over the winter. <br>BUT.. the cost of the MINI has jumped from the low ¬£20k&#39;s at launch to the mid ¬£30k&#39;s and to replace my 2021 model with the new MINI would cost ¬£35k for an equivalent model. <br>I used to own a 2016 MINI Cooper and wanted a similar five door electric (back in 2021).

So I bought a Volvo EX30, which has five doors, is faster (nice but not critical) has Over the Air Updates (don&#39;t want to spend a day at the garage for a 20 min firmware update like I did with the old MINI), is only slightly bigger than the MINI, has a similar ride (but much better suspension) and costs less.<br>IMO as a MINI fan and EV owner, MINI need to add a five door Cooper and drop the price or up the range (one or the other) as the current options are poor value, when compared to Smart #1/#3, Volvo EX30, MG4, the soon to arrive Renault 5 and now the prices have dropped, Corsa E and Fiat 500e. <br>The same was true of the Honda E.

You got to consider the Mini factor, about 100miles is about 90miles once you&#39;ve really booted it! I loved my &#39;old&#39; Mini Electric but with a fatal flaw of 90miles range, it really wasn&#39;t usable even for motorway commuting as you can&#39;t guarantee the destination would have charging and public charging is so costly anyway. I suspect with the newest mini ev, the range of approx 150miles would drop to around 130miles once you had abit of fun in it! Still not a usable range in my opinion, I think 200miles is an optimum range in the UK to get from A-B and back again without getting stung by public charging, which in some cases is more expensive than fuel... I think it should really be used to top up. I found myself regularly charging near empty at public chargers. I&#39;ve gone back to petrol.

First, I absolutely love your channel!  You guys do such a fabulous job with both the pros and cons of owning a MIni Cooper.  That said, I disagreed with the one negative comment that was made regarding how there hasn&#39;t been many changes over the years to the overall style.  For me, there has been too many changes in order to modernize the brand.  They need to stick with the retro look.  I remember the days when all the cars looked different from each other and nowadays, with very few exceptions, they all look relatively the same. No artistic characteristics that makes the car unique.  The dashboard of the Mini should keep as close to the original style as possible.  Trying to keep up with the Jones mentality is what&#39;s ruining the auto industry.  The Mini roadster was so cool!  I understand sales weren&#39;t going well, but to discontinue it was a mistake.  The trend at that time was to make larger vehicles to please the damn soccer moms.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmjv0fyiX4A,Old Classic Car,2021-10-13T07:00:15Z,8277,"I&#39;m a late-comer to the Mini scene, although I have grown up with BMC-era Austins (primarily A30 and A35).  I did once own a 1974 Morris 1300GT and totally regret selling it because it was not only comfortable to ride in, but it was also very quick and the owner after me wrapped it around a telephone pole....but I digress.<br><br>I helped a mate pull a dilapidated hulk of a &#39;64 Mk1 850 Morris Mini-Minor out of a field on a farm when we were both 15.  He&#39;d been given it by his brother (who was share-milking the herd at the time) on the proviso that we could get it out from under the trees where it sat for 3 years, get it running and drive it up to the farmhouse about a mile away.  It was half buried in Macrocarpa needles, but we dug it out, pushed it into a handy barn because it was raining and set to work.  The electric fuel pump didn&#39;t work, so I hooked up a drip feed to the carburettor using the original Tudor washer bottle (I&#39;d seen my Dad do that to an A30 we had on the lawn a few month&#39;s prior) while my mate cleaned the plugs, points and dizzy cap poles.  Ironically, I had to siphon fuel from the Mini&#39;s tank to fill the washer bottle!  One other minor issue was the lack of floor in the boot to put the battery on, so I pushed the mains cable through a rust hole into the back seat area, ripped the earth strap off the boot remains and clamped that to the metal lip of the RH companion box. The battery was then jammed between the seat back and a lump of timber that sat against the front lip of the lower seat shelf and connected up.  She fired up more or less straight away after that.  The car had brakes (surprisingly) but the clutch didn&#39;t disengage so you could get it into gear until you pumped the pedal about 20 times.....but we figured it out, got it moving and drove it up to the farmhouse in triumph.  The next couple of days were devoted to fixing what we could (the fuel pump was an easy first target) with no money, no spare parts, a limited tool set and my knowledge gained from working with my father on his (and his mates&#39;) mechanical projects over the years.  We had a ball - and the car became a very smart beasty that gave him a lot of very reliable miles over the next few years.<br><br>Fast forward to about six years ago and my youngest daughter is following me around classic car shows....and she sees a Mini up close for the first time and falls in love with it.  Fast forward to last year and my eldest decides she loves the car I bought for the two of them to learn to drive in and wants to keep it as hers.  My plan was for them to buy their own and the &#39;learner&#39; car be on-sold.....but plans sometimes have to change.  Youngest then announces that she will need a car to learn in....and that it should be a Mini.  So...sitting downstairs is a 1977 Mk4 Austin Mini 1000 powered by a 1275cc engine.  I was determined that some things were going to happen to it to improve its safety a touch - ones I could get away with without having to get them certified, which is a long and tiresome process in this country, with much red tape and usually with an inspector who interprets rules as he sees fit, rather than bearing any resemblance to fact.....but I digress again.  It now sports 7.5&quot; Cooper disc brakes with EBC Greenstuff pads, widened drums in the rear, 12&quot; Cosmic Mk4 alloy wheels with new tyres, Hella headlights, Hella Comet 500 driving lights, new cones, shocks, stabiliser bushes, engine / subframe mounts and any rubberised or jointed thing up front that had the slightest amount of play has been upgraded or replaced.  The wiring has been checked over and modernised to include more relays and wedge fuses than standard rather than relying on four larger amp glass tube ones to run the lot. The interior has had new pedal rubbers, a volt meter and rev counter mounted tastefully to complete the full gauge set, a pile of soundproofing added under its new carpet (and firewall, doors etc) and all seals and runners on doors, door openings and windows (including the bootlid) are new.  It looks very smart in Signal red with its Old English white roof and bonnet stripes....as long as you do not get too close and see the touch-ups I have done or the work that still needs doing.  I consider bodywork to be the last thing on the agenda as she is likely to get some battle scars during the learning process and these will all be attended to later and have just devoted myself to keeping the rust at bay.  I love driving this little car as it drives like nothing else I have ever driven.  It surely has to be one of the most enjoyable vehicles in that you can drive it so quickly and aggressively and still remain under the speed limit with a huge grin etched on your face!  When Youngest eventually takes it and moves out, it will be a very sad day for me, so I think I will have to buy another one.  Do I have a favourite Mini though?  Yes - I&#39;d love a 1981 or later 1275GT in metallic Chocolate Bronze....or whatever they called the colour (very similar to the Ford colour Roman Bronze).  I love the Clubman shape, but Youngest loves the round nose more....and it just happened that the one we have now was the one that was in the right place at the right time....else it would have been a Clubby GT.....or maybe a Clubman Estate / Countryman.<br><br>Many thanks for the effort in turning all those pix into a film - it was lovely to see them all.",2021-10-13T14:37:30Z,late comer mini

I have the new Countryman S which has 241 horses but the same torque as the JCW version in this review. I love the Countryman S - the interiors are very similar.

I don‚Äôt mine the BMW switchgear - makes sense not to reinvent the wheel üòä, because as you said, there is so much MINI-specific design and quirkiness. I never noticed the daisy Easter egg until I saw your review today. Very quirky! I sold an almost new 2024 Subaru Forester because I fell in love with the new Countryman. Feels like stepping 10 years into the future compared with the Subaru. <br><br>It is mostly a German brand now of course, but I‚Äôve watched loads of videos about this new German built Countryman and they did work with MINI HQ in Oxford, England on the design.

I would much rather see something like an adaptive exhaust system (it is a JCW after all). I also would take the M series X1 over this since Mini tend to not do as well as BMW on resale (even JCW when compared to an M Series car). That Countryman just feels like a causally dressed X series that is trying to call back some of that British charm without making the accountants upset.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmjv0fyiX4A,Old Classic Car,2021-10-13T07:00:15Z,8277,"I&#39;m a late-comer to the Mini scene, although I have grown up with BMC-era Austins (primarily A30 and A35).  I did once own a 1974 Morris 1300GT and totally regret selling it because it was not only comfortable to ride in, but it was also very quick and the owner after me wrapped it around a telephone pole....but I digress.<br><br>I helped a mate pull a dilapidated hulk of a &#39;64 Mk1 850 Morris Mini-Minor out of a field on a farm when we were both 15.  He&#39;d been given it by his brother (who was share-milking the herd at the time) on the proviso that we could get it out from under the trees where it sat for 3 years, get it running and drive it up to the farmhouse about a mile away.  It was half buried in Macrocarpa needles, but we dug it out, pushed it into a handy barn because it was raining and set to work.  The electric fuel pump didn&#39;t work, so I hooked up a drip feed to the carburettor using the original Tudor washer bottle (I&#39;d seen my Dad do that to an A30 we had on the lawn a few month&#39;s prior) while my mate cleaned the plugs, points and dizzy cap poles.  Ironically, I had to siphon fuel from the Mini&#39;s tank to fill the washer bottle!  One other minor issue was the lack of floor in the boot to put the battery on, so I pushed the mains cable through a rust hole into the back seat area, ripped the earth strap off the boot remains and clamped that to the metal lip of the RH companion box. The battery was then jammed between the seat back and a lump of timber that sat against the front lip of the lower seat shelf and connected up.  She fired up more or less straight away after that.  The car had brakes (surprisingly) but the clutch didn&#39;t disengage so you could get it into gear until you pumped the pedal about 20 times.....but we figured it out, got it moving and drove it up to the farmhouse in triumph.  The next couple of days were devoted to fixing what we could (the fuel pump was an easy first target) with no money, no spare parts, a limited tool set and my knowledge gained from working with my father on his (and his mates&#39;) mechanical projects over the years.  We had a ball - and the car became a very smart beasty that gave him a lot of very reliable miles over the next few years.<br><br>Fast forward to about six years ago and my youngest daughter is following me around classic car shows....and she sees a Mini up close for the first time and falls in love with it.  Fast forward to last year and my eldest decides she loves the car I bought for the two of them to learn to drive in and wants to keep it as hers.  My plan was for them to buy their own and the &#39;learner&#39; car be on-sold.....but plans sometimes have to change.  Youngest then announces that she will need a car to learn in....and that it should be a Mini.  So...sitting downstairs is a 1977 Mk4 Austin Mini 1000 powered by a 1275cc engine.  I was determined that some things were going to happen to it to improve its safety a touch - ones I could get away with without having to get them certified, which is a long and tiresome process in this country, with much red tape and usually with an inspector who interprets rules as he sees fit, rather than bearing any resemblance to fact.....but I digress again.  It now sports 7.5&quot; Cooper disc brakes with EBC Greenstuff pads, widened drums in the rear, 12&quot; Cosmic Mk4 alloy wheels with new tyres, Hella headlights, Hella Comet 500 driving lights, new cones, shocks, stabiliser bushes, engine / subframe mounts and any rubberised or jointed thing up front that had the slightest amount of play has been upgraded or replaced.  The wiring has been checked over and modernised to include more relays and wedge fuses than standard rather than relying on four larger amp glass tube ones to run the lot. The interior has had new pedal rubbers, a volt meter and rev counter mounted tastefully to complete the full gauge set, a pile of soundproofing added under its new carpet (and firewall, doors etc) and all seals and runners on doors, door openings and windows (including the bootlid) are new.  It looks very smart in Signal red with its Old English white roof and bonnet stripes....as long as you do not get too close and see the touch-ups I have done or the work that still needs doing.  I consider bodywork to be the last thing on the agenda as she is likely to get some battle scars during the learning process and these will all be attended to later and have just devoted myself to keeping the rust at bay.  I love driving this little car as it drives like nothing else I have ever driven.  It surely has to be one of the most enjoyable vehicles in that you can drive it so quickly and aggressively and still remain under the speed limit with a huge grin etched on your face!  When Youngest eventually takes it and moves out, it will be a very sad day for me, so I think I will have to buy another one.  Do I have a favourite Mini though?  Yes - I&#39;d love a 1981 or later 1275GT in metallic Chocolate Bronze....or whatever they called the colour (very similar to the Ford colour Roman Bronze).  I love the Clubman shape, but Youngest loves the round nose more....and it just happened that the one we have now was the one that was in the right place at the right time....else it would have been a Clubby GT.....or maybe a Clubman Estate / Countryman.<br><br>Many thanks for the effort in turning all those pix into a film - it was lovely to see them all.",2021-10-13T14:37:30Z,late comer mini

Double checked it, when I  got home, to make sure they really did ! Ha...They also gave me  an estimate of what suggested repairs should be as I refused their electronic eval. I just wanted an oil change ! not any diagnosis. Well, they found multiple leaks and even suggested I replaced all tires, which are all having deep threads and grooves,  so NO, not ready to replace. The total was over $8.7K ! Unf.... believable as it is more than the current value of the car. What disgusting scam ! Did they think I am an idiot ?

No more , no less !<br>2) Rear room: You are the problem, not the cars ! You don&#39;t buy a Mini to haul people. Minis are made to haul groceries and other &quot;small stuff&quot;.<br>3) Boot: Barn doors win all the time. I hate garage doors on any vehicle ! But, the best has to be tail gates (like on pick-ups) !<br>4) You don&#39;t buy a Mini to haul a bicycle because bicycles are bigger ! With an adequate rear rack on the bicycle your could haul the Mini on the back of the bicycle !<br>5) If you require the additional purchase of a roof box (Give away !) The car is too small !<br>6) Driving position: The number one shock ! You&#39;re sitting on the wrong side of the car ! ! You would be in heaven if you get a Ferrari F2004 ! It&#39;s seating position is pretty low.<br>7) Ride quality: Really ? We are talking about a Mini are we not ? A lorry has a better ride quality for goodness sake ! Now back to my Flex, that is ride quality. I mean it, try it and you&#39;ll be blown away ! (By the way, did I mention that you are seating on the wrong side of the car !) MY GOOD LORD ! YOU&#39;RE EVEN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD ! ! ! I too had 255/45R20 on my Ford and they are beautiful to look at as with the Minis but I changed for 235/60R18 to get some road comfort ! A wheel rim with a smidge of rubber does not equate comfort ! <br>8) Engine/Exhaust noise: Any one of these are a problem.....return the car promptly to your dealer ! We are in 2021, cars are not supposed to make noise ! I tell you, get a Ferrari F2004, it screams !<br>9) 0-60-0: How does this work out in downtown London ? I thought so ! Just to make things even, my Ford Flex (290 hp) 4700 lbs curb weight 0-60 in 7.7 sec ! (Had I the Turbo oooohhh ! ) It could scream 0-60 in 5.9 sec ! And we are hauling 4,800 lbs curb weight !<br>10) I get the feeling you like go-carts.......oh, you do ! (I&#39;m watching the video and pause as I write) !<br>11) As a second errand getter I&#39;d love a Mini....they are cute and fun little car.<br>12) Great content, love the videos ! Thanks<br>Foot note:<br>I own a Ford Flex AWD Limited (sadly the last year of manufacture 2019).....now for the fun, redo this entire review with a Flex ! You&#39;ll understand everything !

And if you want it, you have to have the money.<br>And for maintenance/parts/mechanics - it sure helps to be on the same continent as the manufacturer - many forget that, so a EU/US/Asian car can be perfect (or a nightmare) simply depending by where you are.<br>And sure, if you are after pure &quot;going from A to B&quot;, cost/bang for buck ratio, or after pure numbers or sole performance (for weekend on racetracks) - plenty of better options out there.<br>So the ultimate reason for me getting - and keeping it for good - is:<br>uber nice ambiente and quality (for a car that size!), an iconic shape, absolutely unique design and details, customizability, all focused on fun and driving, yet refined and grown up enough to make long 2-3 person trips, or 240km/h+ blasts on the Autobahn, or plowing through winding alpine roads in a seemingly perfect rounded package.<br>With the BMW B48 engine in the A20O1 variant also a marvellous, really reliable and very good choice (in fact so good it was since 2014, and still is, the current BMW 4cyl. gasoline engine used in every new BMW, and also the new 2025 Gen.4 Mini, with only very few&amp;minor optimisations needed in all those years - which is an indication for a brand, that essentially was, and is, an engine maker hence it&#39;s name since 1916). <br>With only 1200kg to pull - in a time, where almost every car is 1500 or 2000kg+ (and thus not fun or sporty by physics alone - thus requiring more of all, power, diffs, rims/tires etc. to compensate) - the reason it drives so well&amp;refined.<br>So in 1 sentence: it&#39;s like a sportsbike that touches you emotionally, and it&#39;s the car you already start smiling even when thinking of getting into it to drive.<br>Like drive a Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki - or drive a KTM, Ducati, Harley - if you try, you know there is a difference.<br>There are tons of other cars that are objectively better in this or that metric - but seriously - most of them are &quot;mainstream designed to please everybody and his grandma&quot; = which is certainly not attracting me, boring, dull, uninspiring, all too serious or too comfortable - but in essence certainly not something you REALLY look forward to driving.<br>That&#39;s why JCW (and the Cooper S) is a niche of its own - and a nice, premium yet uniquely/funky/silly designed, daily-able fun car, <br>between the pure but painfully archaic lightweight performance cars (i&#39;m talking BAC Mono, KTM XBox, Caterham Super7, Ariel Atom),<br>the IMO bluntly-lame-as-can-be-designed, can-do-be-all-but-be-nothing-special-by-itself-allrounders, not more than overly fat and weighty sporty versions of mum&#39;s shopping car (Golf, Hyundai and all the others) - or really serious/focused cars (like the GR Yaris) which sacrify style/quality/niceness/&quot;daily comfort&quot; for cheap plastic and pure function, and the expensive/luxurious side of performance cars (the high powered 3 german brands, and Porsche, Ferrari, Aston Martin, McLaren etc.) - you can&#39;t even dare to have fun on public roads, either by speed limits/laws, or the risk of a tiny mishap - as a custom front splitter, carbon bumper or 1 body panel alone costs more than a fully specced JCW... üòâ<br>ps. In my other 2 cars - i also have 3 doors and frameless windows. 4/5 door/SUV? Yikes....<br>ps2. The 18&quot; alloys are too much and beyond the border of diminishing returns. 17&quot; rims/tires are the way to go if you want the best out of a Cooper S/JCW.<br>ps3. Even if you put 1500hp in a i30N - it&#39;s still a dull soccer mom car. It&#39;s not all about function/numbers/metrics/perfectiosn - it&#39;s about &quot;the perfect blend&quot;, and that&#39;s why icons are icons, and last in memory forever (the OG Audi S1 Quattro, the perfectly designed Porsche 911, the OG VW Beetle, the Lancia Stratos, the old SL Merc&#39;s, the C1 and C2 Corvettes etc. - and the Mini....) - whilest the 9th iteration, for the 13th time radically &quot;optimized&quot; version of mass product X is sooner forgotten than you can spell it&#39;s brands name.<br>If you need to google up to know, how the 3rd version of car X looked like: then it&#39;s one of those.<br>ps4. Mazda Miata. That&#39;s a different body style, but good contender/comparison for the JCW.<br>ps5. 2024, 6 years - still running like on day 1, and still loving it like on day 1. It will not be sold.

Its under steer is not happening on streets but is quite noticeable on a track, so not good enough as a track day toy (too pricey as well).

Once they add two extra doors it&#39;s no longer a mini. They discontinued the Ford Focus and VW GTI coupe and the made the Fiesta ST with 4 doors.

Repairs and parts may be expensive, but if you take care of it, that&#39;s unlikely to be an issue. New minis are not super expensive, so probably don&#39;t buy a used one unless you are either familiar with them and can do some of the work yourself, or don&#39;t mind the gamble/costs for the year and model you really want.<br><br>So you may have to spend more on oil changes etc. especially on the turbo models, but the mileage makes up for it....except they&#39;re so fun to drive you may not get that 30-40 mpg. <br><br>I drive an 11 base Cooper I got from a friend. Her parents bought it for her and she isn&#39;t car savvy, but her dad was staunch about her doing the proper maintenance so it&#39;s actually in really good shape and only has 68k miles. I don&#39;t mind working on the Prince engine (so far). The running joke is that you can technically rebuild almost the entire engine without removing it from the bay. I&#39;m shopping for a new car, but I am keeping the mini for a fun weekend drive/project car. I do open it up from time to time, but mostly keep it under 4k RPM and get around 35 mpg. Mine may be an automatic, but it has the semi-manual option, with sport mode and I can turn of the traction control, so I enjoy it plenty when I want to. I get some looks like &quot;THAT 6&#39; tall guy drives a cooper blasting metal?!&quot; and yeah, it&#39;s a bit absurd, but I get my creds back at the auto store because I work on it myself for the basics, doing most of the maintenance right in the parking lot.",2023-10-03T01:15:41Z,short answer mini cooper mostly high maintenance rock solid properly maintained often appeal people rigid maintenance used one tend need lot work reliable maintenance great car repair part may expensive take care unlikely issue new mini super expensive probably buy used one unless either familiar work mind gamble cost year model really want may spend oil change etc especially turbo model mileage make except fun drive may get mpg drive base cooper got friend parent bought car savvy dad staunch proper maintenance actually really good shape k mile mind working prince engine far running joke technically rebuild almost entire engine without removing bay shopping new car keeping mini fun weekend drive project car open time time mostly keep k rpm get around mpg mine may automatic semi manual option sport mode turn traction control enjoy plenty want get look like tall guy drive cooper blasting metal yeah bit absurd get cred back auto store work basic maintenance right parking lot,short answer mini cooper mostly high maintenance rock solid properly maintained often appeal people rigid maintenance used one tend need lot work reliable maintenance great car repair part may expensive take care unlikely issue new mini super expensive probably buy used one unless either familiar work mind gamble cost year model really want may spend oil change etc especially turbo model mileage make except fun drive may get mpg drive base cooper got friend parent bought car savvy dad staunch proper maintenance actually really good shape k mile mind working prince engine far running joke technically rebuild almost entire engine without removing bay shopping new car keeping mini fun weekend drive project car open time time mostly keep k rpm get around mpg mine may automatic semi manual option sport mode turn traction control enjoy plenty want get look like tall guy drive cooper blasting metal yeah bit absurd get cred back auto store work basic maintenance right parking lot

I&#39;m not some diehard MINI fanboy by any means but I&#39;ve owned a few different versions of the early series Minis and the R53 Cooper S Manual with a (15% PR ) was my pick of the bunch, it was a real blast to drive, especially with the easy to fit smaller S/C pulley it became a spritely little rocket that left many WRX owner red faced back when they were considered &quot;Fast&quot; <br><br>I&#39;ve seen 10-15 of your reviews and have always appreciated the extra effort that goes into finding and securing a really nice example of the model range your reviewing, however with that said I&#39;ve gotta ask, WTF happened for this MINI review? I&#39;d really like to know why you just settled on this canary yellow puss box as your feature test vehicle? As far as MINIs go this is about as pox and undesirable as they come. <br><br>OK yes I understand it&#39;s not a GOLF R or an M3 or something the majority of enthusiasts will froth over, HOWEVER the R50 R52 R53 series MINI COOPER S and JOHN COOPER WORKS have an extremely loyal and super enthusiastic fan base world wide, and dare I say it even the most staunch of V8 diehard car enthusiasts would still find the Cooper S review interesting even if they&#39;d never admit it ü§£ <br><br>My point is this, I can understand why you wouldn&#39;t put much effort into trying to find the nicest example Holden Cruze for example, however these earlier R50 series MINI Coopers are most definitely considered an enthusiasts car and as such they attract plenty of interest. So yes I&#39;m more than a little perplexed by the apparent lack of overall effort when compared to the other 15 odd reviews I&#39;ve seen from this channel. All the other reviews I&#39;ve seen the feature car has always been a fine example or even better. But not so for the MINI? <br><br>for some reason this MINI COOPER review seemed as if you couldn&#39;t care less about it?  Seems like zero effort went into this one, I mean seriously you couldn&#39;t even be bothered removing the Kmart Seat Covers and that putrid dog ugly steering wheel cover???  I mean cmon bro that&#39;s just lazy poor form and it really let the car down, I&#39;m sorry to be so blunt but compared to other enthusiast / special interest cars you&#39;ve reviewed you really have done the Mini Cooper Dirty in my opinion. Well below your normal high standards. <br><br>P.S Toyota YARIS has the most boring bland interior styling but I think putting the Mazda 2 or 3 in the same class is a little unfair, have you never sat in an SP23?

However, it is a major pain in the @zz working on it. One thing I recommend is to immediately change out the stock coolant reservoir with a metal welded seam aftermarket one. It is notorious for the stock plastic tanks to bust at the seams and if you don&#39;t see the overheating warning light, you can quickly blow the engine.... ask me how I know üò°. Also, the plastic clips that hold interior panels as well as the plastic bumper cover, and wheel well shrouds get very brittle and break whenever you work on it. So just pick up a bulk bag of the different types, you&#39;ll need them. He&#39;s 100% right about the weak doorlock cables and the locking mechanism as a whole. Also, make sure the AC system is functioning properly since it is common for the interior exchanger to get a leak which requires the entire dashboard to be removed just to work on it. (oops, just heard him address this issue).<br> I disagree with his assessment of space. With the back seats folded down, there&#39;s a huge amount of cargo space. Also, the front has tons of legroom, more than I need at 5&#39;11&quot;. I only recommend a Mini if you&#39;re just absolutely in love with them. Otherwise... look for something else.<br> Edit: Road noise when driving: I have around a 2000 watt RMS sound system with a 12&quot; sub... so road noise is nonexistent ü§£ FYI, the Kenwood 12&quot; sub with box fits perfectly in the rear cubby and if you have the flap that comes down when you close the hatch, it is completely hidden from the outside.

Romex inside conduit indoors might be OK, but leaving the plastic sheathing there is also a percentage of volume of the conduit cross sectional area that you can exceed. It&#39;s based on a formula and not easy to figure out. Romex can&#39;t be used at all in conduit outdoors, wet, or underground. Around my house there is lots of that done by licensed electricians. I stripped out 12/2 Romex from the sheathing and used the wires in conduit for a project. Also not to code. Same as THHN off a spool but not labeled. I heard some manufacturers have the specs on a data sheet that might be accepted. It&#39;s all accessible to pull new wire if needed. Where I&#39;m at it&#39;s $200 per hour and they don&#39;t know when their electricians can get to you.

Failing to have an installation meet Code means, if you have a FIRE and your house burns down, your insurance company can reject the Claim.  When you put in an installation like a moronic schlemiel, the fire inspector will flag it in a hart beat if there is a fire, expect a flood of inspectors. Also, if you go to sell your home the home inspector will likely flag it and then they nit pick everything and you have to finally pay a professional to do it right.

Just about any version is a hoot to drive. In addition one buys into a cult-like ownership experience in which Mini drivers still wave to one another on the highway and drive long distances for annual events. The Mini offers far more configuration options than any vehicle in its class with literally thousands of variations possible in each version. But that configurability comes at a significant cost. It&#39;s possible to layer on options that take the MSRP to well over $50,000 for a loaded JCW Countryman. <br><br>The $40K MSRP of the model Joe is driving suggests Mini is hoping models with a limited number of popular options will improve sales. And his ad for the local Florida dealer suggesting a $4000 discount from that price illustrates just how dismal the sales figures are for Minis in 2019.  In the first four months of 2018 Mini reported sales of all their models to be 14,264. A terrible number that reflects the lowest total yearly sales in 10 years!  And 2019 is even worse.  This year first 4 month sales  are down to 11,532, a 19% drop compared to 2018. (<a href=""http://carsalesbase.com/us-car-sales-data/mini/)"">http://carsalesbase.com/us-car-sales-data/mini/)</a>   <br><br>At $36K, or so the Countryman is not a bad deal versus comparable rivals like the Golf R, the Civic Type R, and what&#39;s likely to be the real world price of the Veloster N. That assumes, however, that it&#39;s not a loss leader price designed to draw customers into a showroom where they find that the last $36K model was &quot;sold yesterday&quot; but some other more expensive models are still available. <br><br>I think MINIs are great cars. But unless the sales declines are reversed I suspect BMW may decide that tradition, funky design, and distinctiveness aren&#39;t worth the effort.",2019-06-09T17:05:37Z,mini great fun closer jet powered skateboard vehicle version hoot drive addition one buy cult like ownership experience mini driver still wave one another highway drive long distance annual event mini offer far configuration option vehicle class literally thousand variation possible version configurability come significant cost possible layer option take msrp well loaded jcw countryman k msrp model joe driving suggests mini hoping model limited number popular option improve sale ad local florida dealer suggesting discount price illustrates dismal sale figure mini first four month mini reported sale model terrible number reflects lowest total yearly sale year even worse year first month sale drop compared k countryman bad deal versus comparable rival like golf r civic type r likely real world price veloster n assumes however loss leader price designed draw customer showroom find last k model sold yesterday expensive model still available think mini great car unless sale decline reversed suspect bmw may decide tradition funky design distinctiveness worth effort,mini great fun closer jet powered skateboard vehicle version hoot drive addition one buy cult like ownership experience mini driver still wave one another highway drive long distance annual event mini offer far configuration option vehicle class literally thousand variation possible version configurability come significant cost possible layer option take msrp well loaded jcw countryman k msrp model joe driving suggests mini hoping model limited number popular option improve sale ad local florida dealer suggesting discount price illustrates dismal sale figure mini first four month mini reported sale model terrible number reflects lowest total yearly sale year even worse year first month sale drop compared k countryman bad deal versus comparable rival like golf r civic type r likely real world price veloster n assumes however loss leader price designed draw customer showroom find last k model sold yesterday expensive model still available think mini great car unless sale decline reversed suspect bmw may decide tradition funky design distinctiveness worth effort

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYoGZDYtGz4,LivingLifeFast,2018-08-21T17:00:05Z,3531706,"Impressive for 22 years of age. At 19, my first project build was nowhere near this, but it was a race car, not a show car. Although he did say his Mini was more show than go, I think a few adjustments could make it a much more enjoyable car to drive. Sure it looks impressive having a big turbo hanging out the front of the grill, but for a 1.6L V-tech, a GT3076R making 15psi is massive pointless overkill. Not to say this setup isn&#39;t capable of it, but at 15psi there&#39;s no way that little 16 is making 360hp. More importantly, you don&#39;t need a turbo that big to make that kind of power, in fact it&#39;s counter productive. That little engine has to wind up to over 5000 rpm to make usable boost, and without proper control, once boost comes on it hits like an on off switch. Listen to this engine wind up and you can hear the instant bump in rpm when it finally gets wound up. In a light little FWD mini that means it breaks lose rather than grips, so controlling that power is paramount. Without control, acceleration suffers, and when it HITS full boost powering out of a corner it becomes seriously hazardous. <br><br>With a second gen 2867R you can make upwards of 24psi and start making positive boost under 3K rpm. More importantly, with the right wastegate control and ECU tune, you could have a far flatter power curve and much more linear throttle response. If this youngster did swap turbos, I would strongly recommend not color powder coating the intake turbine as it holds in heat rather than dispersing it. If anything, you could use C-6 Transfer Black coating on the turbine and intercooler to make them more efficient in dispersing heat. Not only does it look cooler than orange, you&#39;d get more respect from people who know what makes real performance. It might be my personal taste, buy it&#39;s always bugged me when show car guys degrade high performance parts by using tham as a convis for more bling. It shows a blatant disrespect for what actually makes it cool.",2019-02-01T20:15:58Z,impressive year age first project build nowhere near race car show car although say mini show go think adjustment could make much enjoyable car drive sure look impressive big turbo hanging front grill l v tech gtr making psi massive pointless overkill say setup capable psi way little making hp importantly need turbo big make kind power fact counter productive little engine wind rpm make usable boost without proper control boost come hit like switch listen engine wind hear instant bump rpm finally get wound light little fwd mini mean break lose rather grip controlling power paramount without control acceleration suffers hit full boost powering corner becomes seriously hazardous second gen r make upwards psi start making positive boost k rpm importantly right wastegate control ecu tune could far flatter power curve much linear throttle response youngster swap turbos would strongly recommend color powder coating intake turbine hold heat rather dispersing anything could use c transfer black coating turbine intercooler make efficient dispersing heat look cooler orange get respect people know make real performance might personal taste buy always bugged show car guy degrade high performance part using tham convis bling show blatant disrespect actually make cool,impressive year age first project build nowhere near race car show car although say mini show go think adjustment could make much enjoyable car drive sure look impressive big turbo hanging front grill l v tech gtr making psi massive pointless overkill say setup capable psi way little making hp importantly need turbo big make kind power fact counter productive little engine wind rpm make usable boost without proper control boost come hit like switch listen engine wind hear instant bump rpm finally get wound light little fwd mini mean break lose rather grip controlling power paramount without control acceleration suffers hit full boost powering corner becomes seriously hazardous second gen r make upwards psi start making positive boost k rpm importantly right wastegate control ecu tune could far flatter power curve much linear throttle response youngster swap turbos would strongly recommend color powder coating intake turbine hold heat rather dispersing anything could use c transfer black coating turbine intercooler make efficient dispersing heat look cooler orange get respect people know make real performance might personal taste buy always bugged show car guy degrade high performance part using tham convis bling show blatant disrespect actually make cool

You can buy a mini split by Mitsubushi with inverter technology, they will last you many years! We had thousands to install and maintain while in Iraq on US military bases. The number one issues we had were keeping the evaporator and condenser coils clean. Also the mother boards go bad on a specific component. These we had to repair ourselves, and a very cheap repair at that! We had many different manufactures of mini splits. The best were Mitsubushi by far. And they were the most expensive, but the electricity they consumed were small compared to the other manufactures. The fan motors would go bad on the off brands, they were sealed motors with no way to oil the bearings. We were in the desert climate. That contributed to this problem. But the main issue was the mother boards. We also learned that the ground to the condenser and cassete wall units must have a frame ground, to both frame units, this helped to prevent burnt component on motorboards! So losing a ground had a detremental effect to many manufactures! So during install, we would have electricians install more grounds. We learned to carry motherboards that had been repaired in our tool bag, any time we had a work order on non cooling, or non heating systems! The instalation of the split systems must be done according to the manufacture instructions. The wall cassette evaporator must hang on wall perfectly level, for proper water drain out rear of unit. Also a proper exact amount of refergerent must be installed. The mitsubushi units had pir technology, so this picks up human movement, once it has picked up this movement, the unit will operate to the predetermined tempeture you had set. Extremely efficent units. Get a liscened installer that has been certified by Mutsubushi. Not just anybody that has a hvac liscense. Mini splits are the way to go. Much cheaper to install, then what this man said. No duct work, no duct cleaning, and think about this, why run duct work in the hottest part of your home the attic!  This is counter intitutive, not common sense. Both major components are easy to get to and maintain.

Being multi head we did have a central controller that had to be wired, but thermostat is not in that unit.  Still it works OK when you learn how to use it--the thermostat readings don&#39;t mean the same thing as you&#39;d expect. A big factor is that the units can&#39;t heat up a room quickly. It is best to keep the units running at an average temperature rather than let the room cool and heat it up. Then you can raise the heat in the room you are in if you like. We&#39;ve never had ours maintained since we got it (for years)-so no maintenance issue, though cleaning the filters is more a hassle than just replacing one central filter. I&#39;m not sure on comparing costs of installation.

He says they are a great way to heat and cool but hard to justify the cost if you already have a high efficiency furnace.

I installed a cooling-heating mini-split back in 2017, and it has worked nicely, both for heating and cooling. Only once it displayed an error message, after a whole year of use. The error was E8, and in desperation, I thought I had made a poor investment, however, an idea hit me an I simply cleaned the mesh filters at the air input in the indoor unit. Worked like magic! It worked nicely again. What I do ever since is to clean them with a dry brush every year, and no problem whatsoever. My opinion is minisplits are great, and highly efficient in both functions. I even took my natural gas bill down by 90 per cent! Another bonus is the water coming out from the outside unit in summer and spring I use it for watering my trees and garden, thus lowering my water bill as well.

I guess cost to the customer would be greater if these units were made in North America. Profits to big corporations and nice dividends to investors is first and foremost.<br>I am hoping to be building a small cottage in the next few years and I have been racking my brains about what type of heating and cooling system to install. Because we are located in central Ontario on Lake Huron and that our setting is rural, my options are this unit, in-floor heating that is operated via propane, a conventional system with duct work or electric baseboards. <br>With electric baseboard heat and with the soaring cost of electricity in Ontario, it is the least favoured option. Then I would have to install portable ac units. If I opt to go with an in-floor heating system, then I won&#39;t need a basement or a crawlspace thereby saving me money on construction costs. A lot of people in my area have had this type of system installed and say how great it is for even distribution of heat. floor temperatures at 65 deg. feels like 70. I haven&#39;t got feedback yet about cooling in the summer months though. If your building is well insulated, you might not need to install ac.<br>I think the conventional system is self-explanatory. Nowadays, furnaces are much more compact and extremely efficient upwards of 98%, so it still hasn&#39;t been ruled out. I will have to compare total costs.<br>This has been a good starting point to get feedback on this type of system. Thanks for sharing it with us.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DHyShrGUXw,Benjamin Sahlstrom,2020-07-20T23:00:00Z,1715606,"I noticed you talked about the ability to cool multiple zones differently. I think it&#39;s important to note that if you&#39;re like me, the esthetic is not nearly as important as the ability to properly cool and heat rooms in my home. I live in Texas about an hour east of Houston, in a modular home. The original ac barely made 10 years, and was terrible for efficiency and effective heating and cooling. In the past seasons my family suffered due to overheating and cooling in certain parts of the house, and no ability to heat and cool the rest. Ducted systems lose effectiveness the farther you get from the unit, so my daughter got blasted being one room away from the unit, while my wife and I got nothing hardly at all, being on the other end of the house. While it is true, the bigger full central air units may last longer, they&#39;re not bulletproof, they&#39;re very expensive, and almost always require professional support when it comes to any maintenance beyond the filters. The smaller mini split units are simple, and can be installed by the diy guy in most cases. An hvac expert should be called when vacuuming the system, but that&#39;s about it. With mini split units, one doesn&#39;t have to heat or cool all the individual rooms in the home, which is much more efficient. I&#39;m a proponent of multiple single zone units, and for one reason. With multiple single zone units, if a unit does go down, I still have the ability to heat or cool other units in my home. As far as price goes... well I try to look at the big picture. Ducted systems seem cheaper at first, but I found when looking at the bigger picture, it ends up being more cost efficient with the mini split unit, even if it doesn&#39;t live as long as the central air unit. That being said, this is a question of the home owners needs and preferences. Either solution can be useful, but for me, I choose the mini split. Oh and just like anything else, price often comes down to the owner. I just purchased a mini split system for my master bedroom and bathroom, and found it to be very affordable... much much cheaper than replacing my entire unit which require changing both the outdoor unit, and the indoor unit as well as all the lines. The bigger unit may be cheaper for others who would not have to replace both units. But the unit I purchased is cheaper than any descent hvac unit available. And no I didn&#39;t buy the cheapest unit out there. I can&#39;t afford the best units, but I&#39;ve found that many times a good middle of the road unit provides great value. It&#39;s still a quality unit, and it can be affordable for those of us with limited budgets. All invested, my unit will come in at about $1200.00 completely installed and running. This comes with me doing all the install, and the electrical work. An hvac specialist will be called to pull the vacuum on the installed unit. That&#39;s much better than the $4000.00 -- $6000.00 minimum I was quoted for replacing my old system. Now keep in mind that I would have to spend significantly more if I decide to do multiple units, but even then the cost still comes up less when you consider the efficiency over several years use.

It creeps up to 76 downstairs and +80 upstairs. Up stairs is over the garage bonus room with full bath. I am planning replacing my up stairs central air with a mini split. I got a quote. I was going to have to do SO MUCH WORK with electricity, structural penetration and drain it was not worth it. The quote I got was high and assume I provided all the electrical, drain and structural pentation. The DOWN side is being on the second floor you have to mount the outside condenser unit at ground level (or low enough to access standing on ground).  If I could mount it at 2nd floor level it would be better. However it looks like replacing the central air/furnace is the way to go.  I traveled in Asia several times for business and vacation and mini split is common. I like them especially for the situation I have over the garage with one big room. However after looking at this video, and getting the high quote (where all they did was run the lines and mount the units, with electrical and refrigerant line penetrations done) it is a no brainer. I will replace the central air/gas furnace.  BTW the gas furnace works like a champ.... but we have fairly mild winters.

Luckily they face north and I can keep some foam board insulation sitting behind them for now but my 24000 btu Daikin unit doesn&#39;t even struggle to keep up. When it is 115 plus out I can kick it down to 70 if I want too with no problem but lets face it when it is that hot out I might catch a cold at 70. So far my electric bill has not even suffered from them units being installed yet either. If they continue to perform this well when the time comes to replace the main house unit I will most likely go with a few mini splits plus lets face it if something does break at least you do have more than one unit in the house. I disagree with the over cost as well I have priced out standard units vs minis and the mini are cheaper plus the fact I can do most the installation myself that is even more savings. Than you add the long term electric saving over the operating life I think it become even more or a no brainer.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DHyShrGUXw,Benjamin Sahlstrom,2020-07-20T23:00:00Z,1715606,"Hmmm. Ducting wastes up to 33% of your HVAC energy, depending on the design of your house. We have a single level, 3000 sq ft home (all-electric). The ducting is entirely in the attic and the insulation on this (flexible hose) ducting is R8. That&#39;s where the 33% calculated losses came from. Living in Arizona, attic temperatures routinely exceed 140 deg F. As our home was built 15 years ago, the HVAC units (2 of them) are rated at SEER 14. Our units have proven very reliable, but that&#39;s because we run our system at 80 deg F - most people choose a lower temperature which means the HVAC units run harder (and die earlier). Most of our neighbors (in a 15 year old community) have had to replace their central units.<br><br>Configuration: So then, I installed mini-splits into all our enclosed rooms (bedrooms, offices). We retained a single unit to cool the open areas but brought ALL the ducting inside the cooled space. The mini-split systems (5 of them) were brought under computer control so, for instance, bedrooms are cooled ahead of bed-times and allowed to drift higher during the day. The system is linked to Alexa so we can even phone-in commands on the way home.<br><br>Price: The TOTAL cost of our 5 mini-splits was under $5,000. They are Panasonic and Mitsubishi (prices have risen as mini-split popularity is beginning to take off). Total peak capacity was 7 ton. This eliminated an existing 5 ton HVAC unit. When we priced upgrading our central unit to SEER 21 (which required replacement of both the head unit (in the attic) and the outside compressor) the cost, including installation, came to $15,000 (give or take). That was the CHEAPEST quote we got from Valley HVAC suppliers. This did not include improving the attic ducting to reduce thermal losses in the system. Our mini-splits vary, but are rated between SEER 19 and SEER 23.<br><br>Control. The computer system which runs the mini-splits is a small Raspberry Pi Cloud to eliminate single-point-of-failure - I designed and built the system myself. It has infrared cameras in every room that allow the computer to learn patterns. The same system also acts as a fire alarm and the system can calculate best egress path which in the event of fire is communicated through floor lights and voice. The system also acts as a self-arming home alarm system. The entire control system, including cameras, came to $2,500.<br><br>Noise: When our house was built (track home) the HVAC units were positioned between two bedrooms. They system was always incredibly noisy whereas the mini-splits are almost inaudible. I would rate the switch to mini-splits, especially for the affected bedrooms, to be a major advantage of mini-splits. They are simply much, much quieter. Of course this was a consequence of indifferent, indolent home design but it&#39;s a problem I&#39;ve seen many times.<br><br>Endurance: The units I bought are common-place in Europe, the Middle East and Far East. You see the American solution almost nowhere when you travel because it is expensive, hard to retrofit and a maintenance nightmare (especially in the Middle East where houses are often extended vertically over years). I talked to many HVAC engineers in the Middle East (Egypt, Jordan, Syria) and the consensus was that modern mini-splits are good for 20 to 25 years. Come back in another 15 years and I&#39;ll tell you how I&#39;m doing! To date, none of our units have failed. They are easy to keep clean (because the head unit isn&#39;t in the attic)<br><br>Redundancy: So we have 5 mini-split systems. This means if any one unit fails the rest continue and we maybe lose a bedroom or office while the failed unit is replaced. However this compares favorably to the nightmare situation where a central HVAC system fails in the middle of an Arizonan summer (temperature today in June is expected to hit 118 deg F). We own several rental units and when the HVAC fails we are obliged to move tenants into a hotel until the system is working! Of course summer is peak-demand on HVAC technicians so expect delays of up to 2 weeks if the entire system needs replacing! This makes mini-splits a highly advantageous solution if, like us, you are cooling individual rooms (or maybe two rooms with multiple head units) since you can always retreat to the remaining cooled rooms should there be a failure. We intend to retrofit ALL of our rental units.<br><br>Quality of life: I like to run our workout room and offices at lower temperatures - both are brought to a cooler temperature either on a routine or on demand. We can do this without cooling the rest of the house and wasting energy. We&#39;ve found that mini-splits allow us to have a much more comfortable experience at home (especially in the covid era) while saving money!<br><br>Disadvantages: Really there are just two. First, there is likely a need to run additional wiring. Removal of one central HVAC unit gave us a good 220V supply on one side of the house but we needed to add another 220V, 40A run on the other side of the house. I am an electrical engineer so this wasn&#39;t a problem for me, but electricians are ludicrously expensive (the minimum quote I got from a professional was $1,700 for a single run down the side of our house). Second, there is the problem of finding appropriate locations for the outside units which do not hinder passage (down the sides of the house) and do not look ugly. As a retrofit this require a lot of thought and careful design - in some cases a reasonable solution may be impossible. Sorry! Another disadvantage was the quoted installation costs from HVAC companies - they wanted more to install the systems than the systems actually cost! That could be just an Arizona phenomena but I was shocked by the money they wanted (something like $1500 per unit excluding electrical wiring). So I simply did it myself. To help out I bought a two-stage vacuum pump, gauges and a nitrogen tank (welding supplies) so I could thoroughly test the system for leaks then prepare for the released of the refrigerant (which is held inside the compressor when shipped to your house). Once I was satisfied there were no leaks, all you do is open a valve and the system is ready to use!<br><br>Operating costs: Based on 5 years experience (6 in November) the mini-split solution has more than halved our HVAC energy usage, with corresponding savings on our electric bill. I estimate the entire system, including the control system, will completely pay for itself in less than 8 years. This makes mini-spits a far better investment than solar (although we have that too) while improving quality of life. In our case we installed mini-splits as our existing central systems approached end-of-life (which in Arizona is roughly 15 years for the Goodman units installed in our community). So the cost was actually much, much cheaper than installing a new SEER 21 central solution.<br><br>Summary: In my opinion, attic ducting should be made illegal in hot-climate States (especially Arizona). All ducting should be designed to run within the cooled space. That&#39;s an immediate 33% saving here in Arizona. The design of mini-split systems COULD be improved. I would like to install pressure and acoustic sensors, ammeters and fan speed monitors in order to predict failures and provide accurate diagnostic information on a real-time basis. Also, getting the information to put the mini-splits under computer control was not easy - very few manufacturers were willing to cooperate with me. I can&#39;t explain why since this would surely allow them to sell more &#39;solutions&#39; to American homes. If I were to design a new home it would most likely be a hybrid system because cooling large open areas with mini-splits is highly problematic. I would certainly be more careful about positioning the external unit (away from living areas) and all ducting would be inside the cooled spaces of the home. I would design-in locations for the mini-splits so they are not an eyesore. If I do retain a central air unit, it will be located inside the living area rather than the attic. Service technicians are human too - they don&#39;t like crawling around in attics in the middle of summer!<br><br>At the very least, if you watched this video, you may be considering using mini-splits for bedrooms or offices. If so, I can tell you that mini-splits are a great option. If you are a competent (and somewhat brave) DIY&#39;er then you can reasonably tackle this project yourself. Make sure, ahead of time, that you know what is needed in terms of power. Although you can buy some 110v solutions, I&#39;d recommend 220v and running new wiring as-needed. You need to check your fuse box has spare slots and that you do not exceed the capacity of the box in terms of current. You must duct external wiring (code) and require a disconnect box (also code). We have a 200A fuse box which worked out perfectly. Note that electricians are rip-off merchants - many think they can charge $150 to $220 an hour for labor whereas I wasn&#39;t prepared to spend more than $50 to $70 an hour. HVAC technicians? It depends heavily on finding a &#39;tame&#39; technician who offers realistic prices. For our rental units we have such a person but it took us 10 years to find him! To-date none of our mini-split systems have failed. Cleaning filters is fast and easy, so it&#39;s become something we do every month. For our central unit, I installed a pressure sensor which can precisely tell us when it&#39;s time to change the filters (why aren&#39;t ALL houses fitted with this solution?).",2021-06-16T17:29:00Z,hmmm ducting waste hvac energy depending design house single level sq ft home electric ducting entirely attic insulation flexible hose ducting r calculated loss came

I discovered it in Mexico while building a vacation home. In fact, no one down there buys the old technology because all it takes is 2-3 months of electricity savings, and you already have re-couped the 15-20% difference.  Inverter tech has also started to be incorporated into refrigerators and microwaves in many countries.  I&#39;ve seen a 30-50% decrease in my electricity bill over the past 18 months. After problems with my original HVAC, I went and got 4 split system units. I no longer heat my whole house. I only heat the rooms we use when we&#39;re using them.<br>The biggest bonus with Inverter Split Systems is they are whisper quiet. Unlike traditional HVAC thermostats, which turn on when a certain upper/lower temp is reached and turns off when a certain upper/lower temp is reached, Inverter technology slows down the compressor and the fan speed of the wall-mounted unit. It maintains the specific temp I choose to set it at.  Finally, yes, all split systems are made outside the US, but four brands are superior. Mitsubishi, Bosch, LG, and Daikin (which owns Goodman). The rest are all generically made and then rebranded, so tracking down parts requires you often to find a supplier of the same unit (but called something else) and obtain parts through them. My neighbors in Mexico have 5 rebranded split system units (Mirage) for 7 years, and they haven&#39;t had to do anything except clean a filter that cleans the air and prevents stuff from getting on the internal heat/cold exchanger. The physics behind the efficiency comes down to two things. A compressor that stops and then restarts uses 3 times the current. And secondly, because there is virtually no noise from the compressors on the roof or the units on the walls inside, there is minimal energy wasted in the form of noise.",2021-06-02T05:53:03Z,something u lagging inverter air conditioning technology discovered mexico building vacation home fact one buy old technology take month electricity saving already couped difference inverter tech also started incorporated refrigerator microwave many country seen decrease electricity bill past month problem original hvac went got split system unit longer heat whole house heat room use using biggest bonus inverter split system whisper quiet unlike traditional hvac thermostat turn certain upper lower temp reached turn certain upper lower temp reached inverter technology slows compressor fan speed wall mounted unit maintains specific temp choose set finally yes split system made outside u four brand superior mitsubishi bosch lg daikin owns goodman rest generically made rebranded tracking part requires often find supplier unit called something else obtain part neighbor mexico rebranded split system unit mirage year anything except clean filter clean air prevents stuff getting internal heat cold exchanger physic behind efficiency come two thing compressor stop restarts us time current secondly virtually noise compressor roof unit wall inside minimal energy wasted form noise,something u lagging inverter air conditioning technology discovered mexico building vacation home fact one buy old technology take month electricity saving already couped difference inverter tech also started incorporated refrigerator microwave many country seen decrease electricity bill past month problem original hvac went got split system unit longer heat whole house heat room use using biggest bonus inverter split system whisper quiet unlike traditional hvac thermostat turn certain upper lower temp reached turn certain upper lower temp reached inverter technology slows compressor fan speed wall mounted unit maintains specific temp choose set finally yes split system made outside u four brand superior mitsubishi bosch lg daikin owns goodman rest generically made rebranded tracking part requires often find supplier unit called something else obtain part neighbor mexico rebranded split system unit mirage year anything except clean filter clean air prevents stuff getting internal heat cold exchanger physic behind efficiency come two thing compressor stop restarts us time current secondly virtually noise compressor roof unit wall inside minimal energy wasted form noise

I haven&#39;t seen any issues with mine running like 6yrs now I think. Mine is a MrCool. It is sized to where it came precharged so you didn&#39;t have to do anything but hook it up yourself. Also when I got it, just like with most anything I buy, I get parts tools filters batteries etc that I will need for maintenance or repairs. I know how to do electrical and that was standard and easily replaceable. The lines are easily recharged yourself (if you have the tools). Looked pretty standard... granted nothing has gone wrong knock on wood so I&#39;ve not had to get all up into every piece... but I don&#39;t see anything that wouldn&#39;t be easily replaceable if I needed someone else to fix it... but yeah, just way more cost effective and efficient than standard window units. And with heaters too. I think the whole system, mount, wire cover panels (decorative), and tools parts materials needed came out to around $2k. Buying a window AC this efficient and a heater this efficient plus tools parts materials to repair &amp; maintain them if needed would be about the same, but take up way more space. And would have to be installed and removed often whereas this stays year round in it&#39;s spot. The separate units might last this long, but not be as efficient year after year... Also, it is WAYYY cheaper to run and my electric bill is fine. I know lots of folks with the big whole house units and they are super hot or super cold because it costs too much money to be reasonable. I think it is way cheaper to cool or heat what rooms you are in than to try to pretend that you can efficiently and cheaply heat or cool your entire house. But yeah, my space is small so a big unit like that doesn&#39;t make sense anyway which is why I compared smaller units. I think it&#39;s better, but that is just my opinion based off a smallish space and this specific appliance. One thing that my location might impact too, I&#39;m in MN as well, is that this is not my only source of heat and nothing in the price range or size would be adequate. My wood stove does most of the work and this just keeps things a bit nicer if I don&#39;t want to get up and stoke &amp; feed the fire for a longer sleep ;) This is more a backup heat wise and so more an AC unit only for me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DHyShrGUXw,Benjamin Sahlstrom,2020-07-20T23:00:00Z,1715606,"Probably the biggest disadvantage I&#39;ve seen about mini splits in the US from a repair standpoint is that you&#39;ll get inverter drive board failure in the outdoor unit after the reactor has failed especially in salt air climates near the coast. Same thing also happens to the reactors from a lack of clean consistent AC voltage during peak electrical usage in the summer. Neither of which is really a fault of their design, but a product of growing population density along the coast and a lack of infrastructure for cleaner energy production and transmission. One can always consistently argue that nothing today is designed and built to last like systems of old. Perfect example is the older refrigerant systems used copper tubing with a much thicker wall because copper back then was much cheaper. Over time as the cost of copper has risen all system manufacturers of coils that utilize copper has seen a decrease in the tubing wall thickness to the point where coils were no longer lasting till the end of manufacturer warranty periods. At this point most have changed from a design point and switched to primarily aluminum designs. On a side note, all manufacturers of residential equipment specifically state in their warranty information that none of their equipment is designed to be used during the construction or remodel phase of a home. They further state to do so voids their warranty. It&#39;s not primarily because of dust and debris with the exception of drywall and ceramic tile dust, but because of the out gassing of volatile organic compounds (VOC&#39;s) from all the building materials and adhesives used in construction. It attacks the indoor coils at the molecular level and compromises their integrity and intended longevity. You can&#39;t prevent that with high capacity media filters or electronic air cleaners. Now before you begin to argue job security let me tell you this. As an individual who has worked in the field performing service, maintenance, repairs, and installs for fifteen years now, my time is just as valuable as anyone else. I&#39;d rather better maintain the equipment by addressing potential problems during annual scheduled maintenance and nurture my customer&#39;s relationship knowing that I&#39;ve effectively reduced the chance that my contract customers require after hour service whilst I&#39;m on call! And because you invested that time in nurturing that relationship during preventative maintenance, you build trust that helps later down the road when it does come time to address equipment replacement. It doesn&#39;t matter what equipment you buy. It&#39;s only as good as the quality of the workmanship that installs and maintains it. That to me is the ultimate job security. It keeps your customers happy which means repeat business and free word of mouth advertising based on your integrity. Businesses seem to forget that consumers will pay for top notch professional service when they are treated fairly and you keep them informed. Your customers AND your employees are NOT disposable. Just consider how much MORE it costs to retrain quality employees or how much MORE it costs to acquire new customers versus taking better care of the ones you have. It&#39;s a win/win for everyone:   customer, employees, and business!",2020-12-26T06:25:20Z,probably biggest disadvantage seen mini split u repair standpoint get inverter drive board failure outdoor unit reactor failed especially salt air climate near coast thing also happens reactor lack clean consistent ac voltage peak electrical usage summer neither really fault design product growing population density along coast lack infrastructure cleaner energy production transmission one always consistently argue nothing today designed built last like system old perfect example older refrigerant system used copper tubing much thicker wall copper back much cheaper time cost copper risen system manufacturer coil utilize copper seen decrease tubing wall thickness point coil longer lasting till end manufacturer warranty period point changed design point switched primarily aluminum design side note manufacturer residential equipment specifically state warranty information none equipment designed used construction remodel phase home state void warranty primarily dust debris exception drywall ceramic tile dust gassing volatile organic compound voc building material adhesive used construction attack indoor coil molecular level compromise integrity intended longevity prevent high capacity medium filter electronic air cleaner begin argue job security let tell individual worked field performing service maintenance repair installs fifteen year time valuable anyone else rather better maintain equipment addressing potential problem annual scheduled maintenance nurture customer relationship knowing effectively reduced chance contract customer require hour service whilst call invested time nurturing relationship preventative maintenance build trust help later road come time address equipment replacement matter equipment buy good quality workmanship installs maintains ultimate job security keep customer happy mean repeat business free word mouth advertising based integrity business seem forget consumer pay top notch professional service treated fairly keep informed customer employee disposable consider much cost retrain quality employee much cost acquire new customer versus taking better care one win win everyone customer employee business,probably biggest disadvantage seen mini split u repair standpoint get inverter drive board failure outdoor unit reactor failed especially salt air climate near coast thing also happens reactor lack clean consistent ac voltage peak electrical usage summer neither really fault design product growing population density along coast lack infrastructure cleaner energy production transmission one always consistently argue nothing today designed built last like system old perfect example older refrigerant system used copper tubing much thicker wall copper back much cheaper time cost copper risen system manufacturer coil utilize copper seen decrease tubing wall thickness point coil longer lasting till end manufacturer warranty period point changed design point switched primarily aluminum design side note manufacturer residential equipment specifically state warranty information none equipment designed used construction remodel phase home state void warranty primarily dust debris exception drywall ceramic tile dust gassing volatile organic compound voc building material adhesive used construction attack indoor coil molecular level compromise integrity intended longevity prevent high capacity medium filter electronic air cleaner begin argue job security let tell individual worked field performing service maintenance repair installs fifteen year time valuable anyone else rather better maintain equipment addressing potential problem annual scheduled maintenance nurture customer relationship knowing effectively reduced chance contract customer require hour service whilst call invested time nurturing relationship preventative maintenance build trust help later road come time address equipment replacement matter equipment buy good quality workmanship installs maintains ultimate job security keep customer happy mean repeat business free word mouth advertising based integrity business seem forget consumer pay top notch professional service treated fairly keep informed customer employee disposable consider much cost retrain quality employee much cost acquire new customer versus taking better care one win win everyone customer employee business

The mini is in the living room and I can feel the heat as I walk through, have it on a timer to come on at 5:30 am. When the fireplace has been out for awhile. It just doesn&#39;t seem to heat well, there&#39;s a coolness to the air. I also have a ceiling fan blowing down to keep the heat at floor level.

They also seem to draw a lot of electricity compared to standard AC units. I just installed a 2-stage Trane unit and on its high stage (the 2nd stage) it was drawing  19 amp, and this  is the maximum draw from the unit because the house was very hot. After the house was cooled down, the unit ran in Stage 1 for the rest of the month, which is at 70% capacity or 13.3 amps. I just saw a mini-split video and the electricity draw to run an 1800 BTU Mr. Cool mini-split for a garage was 6.7 amps. So my Trane central AC was cooling the ENTIRE house and it only used about 6 amps more than the mini-split. My house is 1850 SF and it is in AZ where it is very hot. It was a 104 degrees F outside and my Trane unit easily kept the house at 79 Degree F (which is the set point that is comfortable for me).  The mini-splits just don&#39;t seem to be a good value. My Trane unit includes a brand new, efficient gas furnace, which will also save me money in the winter and the entire unit cost $8,340.00 installed with a 5-yeawr warranty for labor and a 10 year warranty for materials.

Very useful information.<br><br>Some additional important points about ducktless mini split systems.<br><br>These systems are only good choices as primary heat for extremely well insulated dwellings with excellent double/triple glazing. These systems are good choices as only supplemental heat source for dwellings with not ideal insulation and glazing. <br>Some of the reasoning: <br><br>1. heating testing is done at around 40 and 20F. Lower values are extrapolations. Below 20F the efficiency drops drastically. This can be seen in the graph starting around @. <br><br>2. costs are higher than oil heat, unless [state] electricity costs are very low. <br><br>3. Heat is expelled from the head at the ceiling and must be pushed down to the living space by the weak fan. This will not be [efficiently] successful because heat rises and the &quot;whisper quiet&quot; fan is not sufficiently powerful to overcome the thermal forces and other heated air distribution issues. <br><br>4. Heat sensor is in the head at the ceiling where the temperature is much higher than at the center height of the room, or at the floor. Therefore, comfort is a great challenge. A $250 programmable thermostat for each head is a must. <br><br>5. Well skilled/educated contractors [in heat pump technology] are extremely difficult to find.

I have central ducts as well running in the attic in 150 degree heat. 2 splits are Mitsubishi. I do my own maintenance. I had service provider come out and charge 200 for recharge and 300 for cleaning. Learn my lesson that service providers charge more and they don‚Äôt provide the correct procedures. Guessing on how much recharge it needs instead of vacuuming the system pressure test and reweighing the freon charge back in. The fan gathers fluffy content on the blades and stops airflow being one of the important considerations when the system become inefficient. The best consideration I see is how financially economical running mini splits instead of central air. My electrical cost has dropped 2/3 of what I was paying with central. With central units now taking on redesign following the efficiency of mini splits the electrical cost usage has gotten better.  However the unit price has gone up. I prefer mini splits. Low cost to run and independent efficiency in each room.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DHyShrGUXw,Benjamin Sahlstrom,2020-07-20T23:00:00Z,1715606,"Firstly, thanks for doing this video - and all other previous videos. I enjoy watching all of them. Here are the additional minisplit pros and cons from my personal experience...<br><br>Pros:<br>(Electrical) One technical advantage that nobody mentioned: Many minisplits today use inverter technology. So they don&#39;t spike your electrical system - if you have a standby generator, you don&#39;t have to worry about &quot;starting current&quot;. Current slowly ramps up and stays exactly at the required level. So if your generator is not super large, you won&#39;t need to worry about voltage drops that results in lights dimming when then AC &quot;kicks in&quot; - which inverter systems never do. On a traditional system, you need the hassle of installing a &quot;hard start capacitor&quot; to try to minimize this effect. Also, you don&#39;t need to size your generator to run ACs for your whole house ($$). Just the rooms/zones you need. Sidenote - inverter systems also results in &quot;variable tonnage&quot; feature on minisplits. So a 1 ton system might be cooling at a constant 1/2 ton capacity if the room is sufficiently cooled already. <br><br>(Ambient noise) An inverter system minisplit these days run almost silent. You cannot hear the compressor at all. You can only hear the whooshing sound of the condenser fan.<br><br>(Air distribution) Many minisplits come with at least an up/down auto swing air vent - some with left/right swing as well. You can set your desired directional cooling or cooling a room more evenly. <br><br>(Electrical) You do not need a dedicated line running from the breaker box if you are running a smaller unit (up to 12,000BTU or 1 ton) - which you could just branch off from a 120V outlet. <br><br>(Efficiency) The best SEER rating on minisplits in the market is rated at some crazy 42 SEER, typical minisplit of a reasonable price range hovers around 19-22 SEER whereas standard whole house units typically are rated at much lower SEER.  <br><br>(Cost) Other advantage, you don&#39;t need to cool the WHOLE HOUSE if you only need to have one or two rooms cooled. This reason alone saves a ton of power, and hence utility bills. Plus, with Wi-Fi Alexa/Google control available with many systems, you can even remotely cool individual rooms from your phone or with your voice. <br><br>(Cost) A replacement coil in your standard system - including labor could cost $2,000. A replacement of an ENTIRE inside unit of a minisplit is under $300 for the part - and no brazing is required. <br><br>(Cost) Most minisplits use washable air filters, which you can even use a vacuum to clean. No more expensive throw away air filters. <br><br>(Cost) Minisplits are so easy to install that some companies are selling systems meant for DIY install that a typical weekend handyman can do. No HVAC installer needed. Good for the home owner, bad for the HVAC tech.<br><br>(Cooling) Also, even if you have a standard system in your home, there might be a room or some corner of the house where it&#39;s ALWAYS warmer - because moving air through ductwork doesn&#39;t always guarantee even cooling of every corner of the house. Adding a single zone minisplit in those areas will solve that problem. Also serves as an &quot;emergency system&quot; when your main system goes down!<br><br>(Cooling) And obviously, if you have multiple minisplits spread out in every room of the house, if one minisplit goes down, the other rooms are still cooled, so you won&#39;t need to have put a &quot;rush emergency repair&quot; $$ call to the HVAC company. Parts may take time to come in, you just sleep in a different room until it arrives.  <br><br>(Expandability) You can gradually add split units one room at a time when budgets allow instead of having to upgrade the whole house at one time. But planning is needed for external aesthetic reasons (see cons).<br><br><br><br>Cons: <br>(Condensate draining). If you have multiple minisplits installed in your home, you need to figure out a good way to drain the condensate from multiple systems - preferably into a home drain plumbing with proper p-trap. Letting it just drain into your yard can over time cause a muddy mess. <br><br>(Aesthetics) If you do not plan your installs properly, having multiple systems installed by multiple installers in multiple configurations can result in an eyesore.  See this photo for an extreme example <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/17/air-conditioning-curbs-could-save-years-worth-of-emissions-study"">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/17/air-conditioning-curbs-could-save-years-worth-of-emissions-study</a> <br><br>(Air filtration) With traditional systems, you can buy some really nice 3M Filtrete air filters that filters out really fine particles - some even claim bacteria... no such thing with minisplits unfortunately. Their washable reusable filters are typically fairly large mesh design which only filters out larger dust and lint particles.",2020-07-22T20:50:40Z,firstly thanks video previous video enjoy watching

And I am at a loss how you say it&#39;s more expensive. I was quoted $15k for central air ( with 5 year old new duct work ) from a &quot;HVAC Pro&quot; in my area. <br><br>FWIW I installed a 5 zone Fujitsu mini split in connection with local electricians and HVAC tech for less the $5500 total. All I did was the labor of installing the pad / condenser / line sets and hung the wall units. It took me about 8 hours by myself to do the install and the next day the lines were charged and running. All permitted and about 1/3rd the cost of what the pro&#39;s were trying to sell me on. <br><br>He also tried to sway me to going central air based on his opinion that split systems were inferior. A year later and I&#39;m glad I went with my gut.,2020-07-21T00:37:11Z,opinion piece concrete pro con video opinion mention important part running cost substantially le compared central air solar ton cheaper run year round loss say expensive quoted k central air year old new duct work hvac pro area fwiw installed zone fujitsu mini split connection local electrician hvac tech le total labor installing pad condenser line set hung wall unit took hour install next day line charged running permitted rd cost pro trying sell also tried sway going central air based opinion split system inferior year later glad went gut,opinion piece concrete pro con video opinion mention important part running cost substantially le compared central air solar ton cheaper run year round loss say expensive quoted k central air year old new duct work hvac pro area fwiw installed zone fujitsu mini split connection local electrician hvac tech le total labor installing pad condenser line set hung wall unit took hour install next day line charged running permitted rd cost pro trying sell also tried sway going central air based opinion split system inferior year later glad went gut

The ducting is already there right so why not? I ran into some issues. Namely, the circuit required would end up with me having to upgrade my service. I only have 120A service currently and would have to go for 200 because of the backup electric heater that needs to be installed for the new unit. This significantly changed the equation for me and in the end I left the furnace but added a mini split for my main floor which has been a very solid unit thus far....5 years now. It cools well in the summer and does a great job heating the place in the winter up here in Canada....NS to be exact.",2020-07-20T23:35:25Z,thinking replacing home forced air oil furnace traditional air conditioner like suggested ducting already right ran issue namely circuit required would end upgrade service service currently would go backup electric heater need installed new unit significantly changed equation end left furnace added mini split main floor solid unit thus far year cool well summer great job heating place winter canada n exact,thinking replacing home forced air oil furnace traditional air conditioner like suggested ducting already right ran issue namely circuit required would end upgrade service service currently would go backup electric heater need installed new unit significantly changed equation end left furnace added mini split main floor solid unit thus far year cool well summer great job heating place winter canada n exact

When turning a 90 degree corner the steering doesn‚Äôt self centre quickly like other cars I have driven and often needs to manually be brought back. Also in straight line at speed small movements stay in that position and therefore have to keep correcting.

The rev hang (not to be confused with rev-match) on these are amongst the worst i&#39;ve encountered on any car [regardless of Sport or Mid mode]! It makes it impossible to shift up quickly (you can actually see it in the video at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fGdugVi_JA&amp;t=970"">16:10</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fGdugVi_JA&amp;t=974"">16:14</a> ). It looks like bad shifting, but it&#39;s not; the revs are just not dropping fast enough when shifting up [it literally takes 1.5 seconds until it drops]. MINI did this on purpose to meet emission standards. Upon research as of May 2023, no one has figured out how to disable it that I know of. [Seriously, test drive a new Miata ND and you&#39;ll see how quickly you can shift in that due to little to no rev-hang]<br><br>I&#39;m sure it just takes some getting use to, to shift &quot;smoothly&quot;. I also test drove it with the new 8speed Auto and it&#39;s quick, however not as engaging.

If I may...a word of caution when it comes to the classic diesel engine belief they are just broken in if the hours seem low. As you are probably very aware, Marine diesel engines are an engine parts &amp; repair shops dream come true. With Mann diesels, it&#39;s like hitting the lottery.<br><br>Beware, those Mann V-12s are not cheap to maintain. If you skip maintenance, it <b>WILL</b>  burn your wallet later. Once they pass 6,000+ hours, they will eventually vapourize your wallet to the sea floor if they are not run frequently. At 3,500 hrs over 12 years, that&#39;s an average of 291 hrs / yr. That&#39;s pretty good. It really depends under what load conditions they&#39;ve been run. <br><br>These engines need to be run at ¬æ load or more at least once every 60 days, if they are going to make it past 5,000 hrs.  Depending on the specific model, the Time Before Overhaul (TBO) can vary between 5,000 and 18,000 hrs and annual Max load hrs. The turbos can be finicky. These particular engines are no longer in production. The Block and bottom end are still in production. But the cylinder heads, fuel injection and valve train have all been replaced and are not backwards compatible.<br><br>Getting parts as time goes by should be okay. Mann support is pretty good, but pricey. 100% more than Cats or Cummins. <br><br>Overhauling these engines will cost a small fortune. At 3,500 hrs, they are mature engines and in imo, well past break-in. üòé<br><br>The general rule of thumb with Mann diesels, the higher the max rated HP at high RPM, the lower the TBO will be. The top of the line Mann 1,600 HP 24 liter V-12 at 1,800 max RPM has a TBO of 18,000 hrs. While a same rated HP model that runs at 2,300 RPM has a TBO of 5,000. <br><br>Your TBO will vary based on operator management. üôÉ",2021-04-10T11:12:38Z,nice yacht priced competitively may word caution come classic diesel engine belief broken hour seem low probably aware marine diesel engine engine part amp repair shop dream come true mann diesel like hitting lottery beware mann v cheap maintain skip maintenance burn wallet later pas hour eventually vapourize wallet sea floor run frequently hr year average hr yr pretty good really depends load condition run engine need run ¬æ load least every day going make past hr depending specific model time overhaul tbo vary hr annual max load hr turbos finicky particular engine longer production block bottom end still production cylinder head fuel injection valve train replaced backwards compatible getting part time go okay mann support pretty good pricey cat cummins overhauling engine cost small fortune hr mature engine imo well past break general rule thumb mann diesel higher max rated hp high rpm lower tbo top line mann hp liter v max rpm tbo hr rated hp model run rpm tbo tbo vary based operator management,nice yacht priced competitively may word caution come classic diesel engine belief broken hour seem low probably aware marine diesel engine engine part amp repair shop dream come true mann diesel like hitting lottery beware mann v cheap maintain skip maintenance burn wallet later pas hour eventually vapourize wallet sea floor run frequently hr year average hr yr pretty good really depends load condition run engine need run ¬æ load least every day going make past hr depending specific model time overhaul tbo vary hr annual max load hr turbos finicky particular engine longer production block bottom end still production cylinder head fuel injection valve train replaced backwards compatible getting part time go okay mann support pretty good pricey cat cummins overhauling engine cost small fortune hr mature engine imo well past break smiling face sunglass general rule thumb mann diesel higher max rated hp high rpm lower tbo top line mann hp liter v max rpm tbo hr rated hp model run rpm tbo tbo vary based operator management upside face

Then put in a fresh fill of motor oil, drive it for 10-15 minutes and change it.  After that double the time driving, change it again and repeat until the oil you drain out is perfectly clean.  That should take 5-10 oil changes based on the sludge you found in the gas tank.  Also as pointed out turn the choke off, you&#39;ll pick up at least 15 horsepower.  <br><br>Note, transmission oil change would also be a good idea.  Some good news on that front is that transmission oil typically has a long shelf life so just a simple change should do it unless you find blobs of sludge blocking the drain opening.  If it&#39;s all sludged up fill it to the top with kerosene and let it sit for at least a week or two.  Then drain it all out and leave the drain plug out for the last bit of congealed crud to dribble out.  Then a fresh fill of the correct gear oil (look it up because even in the 60&#39;s there was a bit of variety in gear oils).  Do not assume it takes straight 90W because I&#39;ve already made that mistake and totaled a final drive on a shaft drive Honda motorcycle.<br><br>As for what to do with the car once you have it road worthy.

That rear end is not 1969 Cooper. I&#39;ve owned and raced a 1969 MKII Cooper S and several other standard Minis and can assure you of six things. First, a &#39;69 Cooper always has two fuel tanks and two filler caps, one in either side. Second, it is exceedingly rare to find a genuine Cooper with rectangular tail lights. Cooper was a modification workshop, similar to Shelby in the US. They worked with bodies bought in bulk and all of the 69 Coopers I have encountered first hand have had the original round edge tail lights. I have seen one or two online since watching your video with rectangular lights, but along with the missing Cooper fuel tank, I would suggest this may be a modified standard Mini.<br>Third, no one in their right mind replaces the Original twin SU carbs on a car that valuable. The manifolds alone command stupid prices online.<br>Fourth, Coopers by 69 had front disc brakes. They were well-proven rally and race cars and built for competition. Cooper was a racing modification workshop. <br>Fifth, the 1000 badge on the rear is the last straw. The MK. II Cooper ran the very famous 1275cc engine, never a 1000.<br>Sixth, (sorry about the edits, I keep finding new things wrong with the Cooper providence), Coopers were fitted with electric fuel pumps, not mechanical ones as the twin SU carbs were thirstier than the original fuel pumps could supply. <br>A genuine Cooper&#39;s chassis number may be ascertained as follows:<br>YG2S4 followed by an individual body number i.e. 1234 (YG2S4 1234)¬†This number must also be stamped into the radiator shroud¬† Some cars also have the build number (501 less than the body number) stamped into the gutter on the passenger side of the scuttle panel. <br>Similarly, the engine number must fall into this range:<br>9FXEY followed by and individual engine number. <br>My suspicions may prove unfounded, but based just on the absence of the Cooper second filler cap and associated bodywork, I would suggest you check the engine and chassis numbers as explained above.<br>As for the nasty fuel, replace all of your rubber lines. If any ethanol blended fuel has been used in rubber lines, it is likely long disuse has caused the inner rubber to perish and travel into your filter as debris. Never use anything but unleaded in your Mini. They were built to run on 100+ octane leaded fuel. Your motor looks younger than a genuine Cooper 1275 and may have hardened valve seats to use unleaded, but if it&#39;s around 1970-1972 vintage British supplied, you may want to consider valve saver fluid in your fuel.",2020-10-28T09:39:39Z,dude might want check vehicle identification plate bodywork cut shut weld rear end cooper owned raced mkii cooper several standard mini assure six thing first cooper always two fuel tank two filler cap one either side second exceedingly rare find genuine cooper rectangular tail light cooper modification workshop similar shelby u worked body bought bulk cooper encountered first hand original round edge tail light seen one two online since watching video rectangular light along missing cooper fuel tank would suggest may modified standard mini third one right mind replaces original twin su carbs car valuable manifold alone command stupid price online fourth cooper front disc brake well proven rally race car built competition cooper racing modification workshop fifth badge rear last straw mk ii cooper ran famous cc engine never sixth sorry edits keep finding new thing wrong cooper providence cooper fitted electric fuel pump mechanical one twin su carbs thirstier original fuel pump could supply genuine cooper chassis number may ascertained follows ygs followed individual body number e ygs number must also stamped radiator shroud car also build number le body number stamped gutter passenger side scuttle panel similarly engine number must fall range fxey followed individual engine number suspicion may prove unfounded based absence cooper second filler cap associated bodywork would suggest check engine chassis number explained nasty fuel replace rubber line ethanol blended fuel used rubber line likely long disuse caused inner rubber perish travel filter debris never use anything unleaded mini built run octane leaded fuel motor look younger genuine cooper may hardened valve seat use unleaded around vintage british supplied may want consider valve saver fluid fuel,dude might want check vehicle identification plate bodywork cut shut weld rear end cooper owned raced mkii cooper several standard mini assure six thing first cooper always two fuel tank two filler cap one either side second exceedingly rare find genuine cooper rectangular tail light cooper modification workshop similar shelby u worked body bought bulk cooper encountered first hand original round edge tail light seen one two online since watching video rectangular light along missing cooper fuel tank would suggest may modified standard mini third one right mind replaces original twin su carbs car valuable manifold alone command stupid price online fourth cooper front disc brake well proven rally race car built competition cooper racing modification workshop fifth badge rear last straw mk ii cooper ran famous cc engine never sixth sorry edits keep finding new thing wrong cooper providence cooper fitted electric fuel pump mechanical one twin su carbs thirstier original fuel pump could supply genuine cooper chassis number may ascertained follows ygs followed individual body number e ygs number must also stamped radiator shroud car also build number le body number stamped gutter passenger side scuttle panel similarly engine number must fall range fxey followed individual engine number suspicion may prove unfounded based absence cooper second filler cap associated bodywork would suggest check engine chassis number explained nasty fuel replace rubber line ethanol blended fuel used rubber line likely long disuse caused inner rubber perish travel filter debris never use anything unleaded mini built run octane leaded fuel motor look younger genuine cooper may hardened valve seat use unleaded around vintage british supplied may want consider valve saver fluid fuel

They always make me smile. And make me soo proud when we (the mini and myself as i class them as my very own family i love them that much) get to a destination. And always makes me look back and smile when parked up anywhere purely out of pride for them. <br><br>As for the plans. Try to keep it as original as possible. I myself have 4 of them but i always prefer my Mk1 to drive as i love the smell and sounds it makes. It simply being a 1965 car. Its something some people love to pay for when they have restored and modified them and them miss that kind of thing.<br>My main project i have a 1400cc A-series engine all modified up and runs great but plan on putting a Nio EV motor in someday. <br>But having more than one is where the fun really starts. Especially having a mk1 as that is staying an original 850cc With a long gearstick. <br><br>I also thank you for giving me the motivation to get one of my minis sorted. <br>If you need any advice. Please message us on Facebook im on there as &quot;Tayan Dylor&quot; also feel free to check out my two minis also on Facebook as &quot;mark-one themini&quot; and &quot;thunderbirdii themini&quot; üòâüëç <br>And welcome to the classic mini community.,2020-10-06T18:22:11Z,thats draught webber carburettor good cc engine recommend fitting single hiff su carburettor got su cc engine mk austin mini always hiff su cc overbored also hydrolastic suspension total nightmare work easy enough convert rubber type better still coil coilovers changing great problem solver also glad love driving really brilliant car mini since never look back regret always make smile make soo proud mini class family love much get destination always make look back smile parked anywhere purely pride plan try keep original possible always prefer mk drive love smell sound make simply car something people love pay restored modified miss kind thing main project cc series engine modified run great plan putting nio ev motor someday one fun really start especially mk staying original cc long gearstick also thank giving motivation get one mini sorted need advice please message u facebook im tayan dylor also feel free check two mini also facebook mark one themini thunderbirdii themini welcome classic mini community,thats draught webber carburettor good cc engine recommend fitting single hiff su carburettor got su cc engine mk austin mini always hiff su cc overbored also hydrolastic suspension total nightmare work easy enough convert rubber type better still coil coilovers changing great problem solver also glad love driving really brilliant car mini since never look back regret always make smile make soo proud mini class family love much get destination always make look back smile parked anywhere purely pride plan try keep original possible always prefer mk drive love smell sound make simply car something people love pay restored modified miss kind thing main project cc series engine modified run great plan putting nio ev motor someday one fun really start especially mk staying original cc long gearstick also thank giving motivation get one mini sorted need advice please message u facebook im tayan dylor also feel free check two mini also facebook mark one themini thunderbirdii themini winking face thumb welcome classic mini community

Standard spec engines are anywhere from 33-90BHP as standard but people regularly mod the engines to 100-130BHP which is a LOT of power in something this size. Crazy people put diffent engines in and I&#39;ve seen one claimed around 600BHP which is well into widowmaker terratory. People are now starting to do electric conversions on them here and someone is building a Tesla based one expected to hit around 300BHP which in a mini is enough to get to the moon in it.

Io ho una cooper con questo motore, 3 porte, qualche optional che mi interessava, niente luci da discoteca interne, niente cerchi grossi, niente assetto sportivo che ritengo un po superfluo per un utilizzo quotidiano, ma ho comunque messo il selettore di guida sport/normal/green... qualche optional che mi interessava, prezzo 21750 euro.
