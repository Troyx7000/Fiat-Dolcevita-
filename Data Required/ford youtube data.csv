By the time I adjusted the seat where I needed it I couldn't rest my arm on the door because its too short/narrow. Even with the seat all the way back and the seatback tipped back a few notches there's still not enough legroom, plus my right leg rests uncomfortably on the center console.  The seats themselves are hard and narrow with a short cushion as well.  I've rented a few other small economy cars such as the Toyota Yaris sedan (Mazda 2) and it was much better in almost every way.",3 years ago (edited)

Volkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,"I don't get the fiesta hype. Other than the drive, a fiesta is just a fiesta. Everyone's either got one or had one. You can spot a fiesta a mile off and for me personally they are boring. Enter level has an awful entertainment system too. The Polo is more like a golf nowadays, haven driven both, and a new corsa and the new Peugeot 208. Best for me is

2019 Ford Fiesta: Review,"Having delivered pizza for a week in one, here's some thoughts. The steering is decent, gas mileage is decent,  the horse power is decent and the overall handling is decent. The locks delay, the column mounted controls are terrible, the controls for the locks are in the middle which is idiotic. In my case with a hatchback, not much room, even if it's deep, it's literally exactly as wide (front to back) as a pizza bag. Seats fold down, but you got shit in the back seats sometimes, and you're not typically delivering pizza. Speaking of the hatch.l: hold the button, wait, and then you can open. Because delayed reaction with the locks. The seats are hard, and that's comparing everything to the basic ass 2012 Toyota Yaris hatch(great car for the basic assness). The transmission feels like it's going to stall in drive, but sport mode works a little better. There's not much room inside the car. You don't want to have your left leg bent up with your knee resting on the door, because it's just hard plastic, and it's a narrow foot well. The sound system is basic. As far as driving through a town with strict cops, so you're as casual as possible all the time, it's uncomfortable, and shitty. The windshield wipers are pretty good though. The A/C is standard, the lights aren't especially bright and overall... Buy a different car, unless you're stubbornly in love with Ford, which you'd have to be. Or rather small. Which I'm 5'8"" 170 lbs, so if you're RATHER small, you might enjoy. The sportiness looks are awkward IMO because it's so narrow, but that's just me. Don't worry about the spelling",4 years ago

Why is it NOW or NEVER to buy a 2019 Ford Fiesta ST?,"Yes 3 things. 1., you have to accept that there will always be dust!! But you can make things better.  2.  you can buy different brakes that create less dust. I dont know which brands or setups to recommend so you will have to look in the Fiesta ST forums online and do your research - there are definitely tons of threads about brakes on FiST forums. 2. There are ceramic wheel cleaners now. They will leave a ceramic coating on the wheels which will help the brake dust clean off easier next wash. You can also use ceramic wax or ceramic ""wax as you dry"" products.  You can use these on the black painted rims or the alloys.

Right now I'm using Turtle Wax Ceramic Wet Wax. You spray it on your car after washing while it's still wet and then dry. I wash my car first with a ceramic car wash and  a good clean sponge I only use on the paint,  then I clean the wheels with a seperate sponge. It's cheaper and works just as good as wheel cleaner. I use a shammie to dry the car and a seperate microfiber cloth to whipe the wheels. Theres no scrubbing if you keep this up. Just wiping and polishing. Btw I maintain this even in winter  and I live in an apartment near Chicago. So anyone can do it.",1 year ago

Volkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,"Was in the market for a not too expensive car this week and visited a few dealers including a VW and Ford dealer. Gave the Fiesta a fair chance and quite honestly I really disliked the car in the end. The interior was a downgrade from the Polo both design and quality wise but what really killed the Fiesta for me and made me dislike it is that low roofline that's directly in your view. The visibility was notably worse than the Polo's and the roof felt like it was pushing down on you and it had this cramped feeling which I hated. I also much prefered the looks of the Polo when seeing the cars in person plus it's a bit more practical. As far as I can tell the Fiesta's only real advantage is that it's a bit more sporty to drive (according to Youtube, haven't driven it myself) but imo that's nowhere near enough to offset all its disadvantages compared to the Polo, not even close.


In the end I liked the Polo the most of the cars I saw and ended up buying it. Will be able to pick it up in two weeks, the wait is real.


This is just my opinion of course and you don't have to agree with me.


Before anyone says that maybe small cars aren't for me as a reason for me disliking the Fiesta, I currently have a 1999 Nissan Micra which is even smaller yet it doesn't feel cramped and I enjoy sitting in it and driving it. Perhaps some might like the cramped feeling the Fiesta gives but it just wasn't for me.",4 years ago

They sold them as automatics, but in reality should have been driven as a manual. People would burn up tranny's one after another. Ford extended the warranties for 10 years on it. But after having had my car in the shop for 4 months at four different Ford dealers, the service manager took pity on me. Told me look, the part we need to fix your part? Doesn't exist. It's still at least 6 months away from production, and that's if they approve it. So, I wound up selling it back to Ford and even made about $2500 profit after it was all said and done. LOVED my fiesta though...RIP Charlotte, we miss racing in you,  light to light all those freaking Asian cars and going Airborne...",2 years ago (edited)

FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,My wife and I have a 2016 ST and we love it.  She wanted to get rid of her GMC terrain for something more fun to drive and we looked at other Hatchbacks but it had to be a stick.  A lot of manufactures offered sticks but in the bare bones models.  We narrowed it down to the chevy Sonic with the RS package or the Fiesta.  After driving both we realized that the Sonic was all show and no go and it was not very comfortable.  We ended up with the ST with Recaro seats and she has already been pulled over a couple times.  It is pretty fast for a 1.6L,2 years ago

Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"This Fiesta looks all very nice but the problem I have is manufacturers are desperate to make their cars look trendy, modern and fashionable, and appeal to a broader customer base than maybe in years gone by, but in doing so, all these hatchbacks are the same, especially the interiors. All having the 'must have' infotainment screen etc, the layout is the same as any other, just a different badge on the boot. Not all of us wants a car filled with tech either. Some drivers are actually older than 40 ! Can you believe that ? Of course, prices keep increasing with each new model and what we now have is most cars costing far too much in my opinion. The joke is, most are sold on PCP deals, nothing wrong with that but the average trade in time is 2 years on a 4 year deal, with only the dealers making money out of it as you trade it in for another new car on yet another PCP deal. I am doing one of two things. I got rid of the silly Audi because it was a waste of money, and I got a cheap new 3 cylinder thingy on a straight HP agreement, so eventually I will own it unlike the PCP buyers. Secondly, when I can afford to I intend to get a Subaru Forester which will last me for years and years as a tough long term car into retirement and beyond. Dont keep trading in. You always lose money.",5 years ago
Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"Matt straight into the Carwow sales pitch at the start of the video.

Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"The new Fiesta is only marginally bigger than the previous model. I have owned the Vignale for 4 months now and compared to the previous Titanium I owned there is no comparison. The new one is vastly superior in every aspect which surprised me as I loved the Titanium  (2015).
The gearbox has much better ratios and the 6th gear is a real bonus as is the brilliant 124hp engine.
It is a fabulous car, easy to drive as well as having a much more modern infotech system.  The B&O sound system is incredible.

Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"Usually I agree with Mat's views and although this is not different in this case, I decided to go for Vignale (I shall have my head checked soonest!). In my country the Vignale does not come with all that kit (no sunroof or B&O as standard) and so the price difference from Titanium (which normally offers the best VFM option) was very small. The fact that I wanted navigation made the difference negligible, as the price of Titanium plus Navigation was almost equal to the price of Vignale and Vignale has Navigation as standard plus a lot of more extras. I believe Ford's move to offer a Vignale edition is smart because there are a lot of customers who would pay a couple of thousand more to get a clearly 'richer' version - if you intend to keep the car for more than a couple of years, in the longterm it is not a bad investment if it makes you feel better every time you get into your car. And in any case, if you want to go a little more luxurius in a small car, Fiesta is currently the only choice. Otherwise, the car is ok on the outside and very very nice on the inside, I totally disagree with negative opinions about the central touchscreen, it really adds to cars functionality and is very well built. Room is not as good as in competition but it is enough and if do not normally carry adults in the back this becomes irrelevant. Built quality is good and reliability is at least not bad - japanese and korean cars are more reliable but the quality of materials is clearly inferior, design is dull and handling is very compromising, so I still prefer european and the Fiesta has been a reliable car for such standards. In addition, Ford pricing is quite reasonable - on average any extra in the Fiesta is at least 20% cheaper than in their german competitors. And to comment on some other comments, if I may, yes, at the same price of a Vignale you can buy an A1, but an A1 with a minimum kit and essentially 8-years old technology, thus actually you will not go for an A1, you will go for a Polo (at least until the new A1 arrives next year). Ibiza I think is the main competitor, if you like the spartan interior (not cheap but more simple) and you do not care that much about equipment (at same price Fiesta is better equipped) then Ibiza is a great choice and a roomier one.",6 years ago

Why is it NOW or NEVER to buy a 2019 Ford Fiesta ST?,"?@2010ngojo? no it's not all the same people - I was on the market for one so I read the comments on tons of FiST vids.  This car is just fun so reviews and comments make it sound like everyone has one or wants one. People who have one are more likely to watch vids and comment than your typical truck/suv/crossover/electric owner. And those people are the majority of the market, that's why Ford is done with cars. In America. 
Remember, the Fiesta ST is still available in Europe, and it was available there before it was made available in America. It was only made available to America in the first place because it was such a huge hit in Europe.
Therefore, this being the internet and all, most of the comments are actually from viewers and owners in Europe. This is another reason it sounds like the market is huge to an American. Because it is in Europe. But it wasnt in America. 
The few people who did get one in America love it. You wont find any real complaints.",3 years ago

You cannot go wrong. I test drove the Fiesta among others and it is excactly as he describes it. Titanium is the edition you should go for if you decide this is the one for you. Helped me a lot  in choosing mine, however not being the Fiesta mainly  because of the actual limited  back space and smaller trunk compared to competition but admired its handling and comfort.It was a tough choice but finally went for the Polo having more space at the back for two and marginally three adults,even with a sunroof as mine,and more boot space which is important for me, not to mention the DSG auto box which is the best in the class.Got it also with the electronic adjustable suspension which kind of makes up for Fiesta's excellent handling although still not a match.",6 years ago

Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,People in the comments don't understand subjectivity apparently,6 years ago
Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"I've got the 1.5 TDCi 120bhp Vignale version, full extra, except the sunroof (I needed the extra headroom), winter package (I live in a warn country), full leather seats (warm country again) and 18"" wheels (standard 17"" are overkill) and it cost me 21k EUR or 18.3 GBP. I added BLIS, top stereo B&O, and the dealership gave me some extra gifts. I do a lot of km/miles and my average so far for 3k km or 1800 miles is 5.2l/100km or 54.3mpg. On the highway, if you won't go above 60mph, you get around 3l/100km or 94mpg. The engine is superb. You don't understand that it's diesel. Instead, you get a good push from the torque of the engine on all the rev range. For next year, Ford hopefully will replace the 1.5TDCi with the new 1.5EcoBlue which is around 15% more powerful and economic, but they changed the method of measuring the CO2 and you get around 91+gr CO2 rated car. Mine is rated at 89gr. The new engine will have 4 valves on each cylinder instead of 2 of the current, off center crankshaft, precision diesel injection and more psi at the diesel pump. Sync3 is very good system, but spotify is removed since January. You can use Android Auto which is what I reccomend. Another update that may come in the Vignale version will be the led headlights, which are not available currently, but current automatic headlights are superb. In general, the car is ridiculous fuel efficient, and needs service every 30k km or once a year as the dealership told me, but I'll change an oil filter and oil every 10k.",6 years ago

FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"If you want to eat some dog, I have good news
There's an annual dog festival
Where you can eat all the dog you want
And it's located in Yulin Guangxi China

And the festival spans about ten days
With 15,000 dogs consumed
And it goes from the 21st to the 30th of June
I just wanna let you know, I'm just trying to be a bro
So, you first take a flight to Guangzhou China

Once you get off at that airport
You wanna ask around for the Guangxi provincial bus
And it costs 20 US dollars
And it's a four and a half hour ride

And you get off at Maoming West
Just remember, Maoming West
Now, you might have to stay there a full night
Depending on the time you arrive

Because the next bus that goes to Yulin
Only runs like once a day
And you have to buy another ticket
It's about another 22 bucks


But from there, it goes straight to Yulin
Soon enough, you'll be eating some dog
Now, there are about 8 available hotels in Yulin
I'm checking online, now

I suggest the Yulin Lijing International Hotel
Offering a sauna and fitness center
Wow, it's not too bad at all

Never mind, it's 50 bucks a night
But with free complementary breakfast
And a free cancelation fee
So, it's not a bad as I thought

When you're ready the concierge will know
Exactly which festival you're talking about
And he or she will give you directions
So, take a cab

But don't get ripped off
If you're white, they'll charge you double
I shit you not
I shit you not

But anyways, enjoy your flight
Goodbye
Enjoy the dog festival",3 years ago

Instead it's now becoming a by-word for massively overpriced hatchbacks and sedans with a bit of leather and a fancy trim inside of it.

FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"You forgot to mention, that the ST is continued in Europe, with the new 3 cylinder (instead of the 2014-2019 4 cylinder) engine.
The new engine makes the same HP, but higher torque numbers, and is about 50LBS lighter; not to mention, the 3 cylinder is much better for Turbos; and therefor gets a much faster 0-60 time.
We missed out on the best ST ever, in USA.
Still, if they would have made it with a 1,8 liter, and would have made the gearing significantly taller (meaning lower RPM on the highway), the current 1.6L Turbo car, could have easily made 40MPG on the highway, vs current 32MPG (30MPG AVG).

F1 pilots are masters of precisely controlling the revs of the engine all throughout the race including engine braking, selecting the precise moment of acceleration out of of a corner and the loading and unloading of each individual tire. They shift gears via an electrically controlled clutch and an essentially manual gearbox where only the shifts are automated.

What you call an automatic transmission is completely different from that system.",3 years ago

FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"I drove a Mk5 Fiesta ST around south east England the summer of 2006. It was a perfect car on the little  narrow country roads. I spent a lot of time driving between farming towns on local roads with no shoulder and usually tall hedgerows or stone farm walls hemming in the road. Sometimes it was like driving in a green tunnel. The terrain is gently rolling and the roads not so twisty as curvy. The car felt very controllable, going quickly was easy. I had passengers so I could not go too fast but it was still fun to see how fast I could take corners with disturbing the wife.  Also I've noticed the Fords I've driven in Europe, even base models, are nicer than than their American counterparts. They drive better and the interiors are slightly nicer. This was especially true for the Escorts I've driven. In England 80's and 90's Escorts were kinda sporty and young ""chavs"" dudes who wore Burberry baseball caps drove them. The American versions of the same cars were pretty bland. My parents had three different gens of north american Escorts (1st, 2nd and 3rd))and if they didn't all have manual sticks, they would have been horribly boring to drive. Still with the all that under steer I never liked them very much. In fact their 70's Pinto was easier to get sideways and did great parking break turns.",4 years ago

I mean, don¡¯t get me wrong, I enjoy driving manual, but essentially only Europeans still care about that, and what¡¯s worst, it¡¯s all on cheaper, smaller cars. 90%+ of the most interesting cars to drive are now all auto.

Why would you give yourself the trouble? Especially for those who dont even actually like driving?  A normal car commute in the US is, no exaggeration, easily 5X longer than in the UK. Don¡¯t make this a Europe vs US thing. Europe is the proper outlier here. What ¡°enjoyment¡± is there to drive a manual on a 0.9L engine that generates 95hp?  There¡¯s none.

FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"I knew a girl in high school who had a mk1 Fiesta. I got to drive it a few times and it was fun to drive. Sometimes driving a slow car as fast as it will go, is more fun than driving a fast car. The Mk1 is so lightly built and un-insulated that you feel every bit of the road and hear every rattle and squeak. I remember the sound of the doors closing being so metallic with a click instead of today's  cars soft thud. Going 70 in a Fiesta feels like 100. Compared to today's small cars, driving an old Civic or Golf Mk1 or Fiesta Mk1 feels like driving naked. The fun thing about those early small  hatchbacks was that they were so light and nimble on city streets like the ones in San Francisco where I grew up. One late night, my friend and I drove his 1972 Honda Z600 through the pedestrian tunnel under the bleachers onto the mile long packed sand jogging track around the Polo fields in Golden Gate Park.  We were getting sideways on the turns with only the light of the moon to see by and Ozzy blasting on a boom box in the back seat. You could get away with more shenanigans back in the early 80's. There were fewer cops and as long as you didn't hang around one spot too long you could pull some fun stunts.",4 years ago

Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"I really don't understand the Vignale versions for the Fiesta or Focus. Realistically someone who buys an Audi A1 or A3 (the type of car I assume Ford is trying to compete with) is not going to buy a Ford. They have a good thing with the Fiesta and Focus being the UK top 2 most popular cars of 2017, they should maintain that and forget about chasing the big germans with 'luxury' versions of those cars. Personally, I think if they invested all that time and money into the other versions, they could have combated the practically issues with the cars, like the boot space and rear seat passenger comfort to bring it level with the Polo, but have the edge in driving experience to make it the all round better car. A lot of people will buy a Polo for more space rather than the Fiesta for fun driving.",6 years ago

I think Ford made a mistake but if they sell then I guess they were right. I have configured an A1 out of curiosity and for a 1.4 tfsi 6 speed manual with 18 inch alloys it's coming out as just over ¡ê21'000.Yes optional extras might add a couple of thousand, but perhaps not all that much cheaper in comparison, especially when the quality isn't quite level with the A1.

On average it gulped about 53 mpg of diesel. The best part about it? I got it tuned on a piggy back ecu with some popcorn backfire, some months after, and pushed it to around 130hp/250lbtq (0-60 in 8 secs) on its limits, and still, the mpg didnt even change unless i was on WOT.

+ in the end a car should be fun to drive.

Also, I don't think the comparison with respect to looks is completely fair. The vignale is a look my grandparents would buy. However, comparing the ST line versus the polo, I'd go the new fiesta ST any day.

For me personally as a car lover: Fiesta ST.

Anyway, Fiesta looks better, has better engine, interior and it's better on road. 

But, I would argue that those two are best small cars...i had Nissan Micra for 2 months for replacement,and neather of those 2 don't look as good, and I presume they are not same quality of interior.,especially VW Polo.

Than, I hade Renault Captur for 2 weeks as rent a car,  that car is based on Clio,which I didn't had opportunity to try, but if it very like Captur as I am guessing it should be, that would be my personal favorit in city car segment.",5 years ago

Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"Just changed my car and the Fiesta was at the top of my initial shortlist. Right up to the point that I got to poke around one in the metal. Incredibly disappointing as there's far too many compromises that put it way behind rivals. Some are touched on here (the lack of space in both boot and rear seats is genuinely surprising considering what, say, a Honda Jazz brings to the table) but general build quality felt poor and, frankly, cheap. That touchscreen looks like something found on far cheaper rivals, the gloss black plastic was already scratched to hell on all three showroom cars and the door trims felt like they were from the 90's! For a car that's priced around the same as the VW Polo that's really not good enough (think there's around ¡ê400 difference between the Titanium recommended here and the equivalent SEL).  It may well be much better to drive but the vast bulk of my mileage is motorways and town driving. I suspect I'm not alone in this and would far rather sacrifice a little dynamic ability for refinement. Such a shame as they were on the right track with this car but it feels like they're costing on the popularity of the model and know they don't have to pull out all the stops. Good enough will do (and, I'm sure, is better for the bottom line). 

In short if you're thinking of this car by all means go ahead and audition it but I'd urge you to have a look at what else is available before putting down the deposit.",6 years ago

The main thing is keeping the fluids changed and letting it warm up before you really get on it. You really gotta keep it clean, too. The paint is cheap and likes to chip. Some of them even have peeling paint, but mine's still ok.

FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"Its also noteworthy that Princess Diana's first car when she married Charles was a 1st generation Fiesta 1.1 Ghia! (Her very 1st car was a Rover Mini Metro) In fact, Diana loved cars, and various photo's shows her driving different Fords (and always Ghia or top spec). She was a true Ford-fan, and can be seen driving (herself) a (very hot) mid-80's black Escort RS Turbo, red 80's Escort Ghia and XR3 Convertible (with roof down), grey Sierra Cosworth 4X4, and she had a wine-red as well as a dark green Granada Scorpio 2.9 V6 Ghia 4X4 (Cosworth version) for years as a personal car!


When she divorced Charles, and wanted to show the Royal family the middle-finger, she went German-crazy - a Merc 500SL, Audi 80 2.6 V6 Cabrio, a e36 325i Cabrio and e39 528i then followed.


Lastly - most people think she died in Dody's Merc S600 V12, while it was actually a S280. And since it was the stupidly-underpowered ans slow S280, I can understand why they couldn't escape the paparazzi, forcing the chauffeur to drive recklessly and crash...",4 years ago

Renault sold 3.7mil cars in 2017: https://group.renault.com/en/news/blog-renault/groupe-renault-global-sales-results-2017/ 
I don't have numbers for Ford in 2017 but if you're trying to suggest that Ford lost half their sales in 2017 compared to 2016, you're delusional.  

Get a grip dude. VAG is the largest automotive conglomerate in the world, is it supposed to be surprising they're on the top spots in number of vehicles sold when they own 8 brands while Ford and Renault are each one brand?

Volkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,"Soft plastics? Well, maybe in Europe. The vehicle we got in Brazil has a very shitty, rough-feeling and opaque-looking plastic. I'm gobsmack you actually praised the plastics quality! Granted, the materials we get in the Fiesta (which got only a front-end facelift, we're not getting the new ""new"" one) are just as bad. Looks, though, i'm all Ford. The polo looks cheap and forgettable. 

Boot space is always welcome. VW +1 on that. But i'm more concerned about space on the front seats. I almost never have people seating in the back and i'm 6""5' (and I do sport a bit of a belly) so front roomyness is of utmost essence. And i do not like how cramped the old Mk7 fiesta feels. 

About the door closing feel. I never liked how compact Fords close their doors. It just feels like there's no rubber to atenuate the hard latching of it. I do really like the new Dacias. They have a smooth and muffled ""plop"" to it that i truly appreciate. I had a peugeot 308 that had very satisfying door operation too.

For the looks and the peppy engine: Fiesta. For the economy and roomyness: Polo. What i'd actually buy? NEITHER! I hate how hatchbacks' boot doors always start making noises. I'm all for sedans",5 years ago (edited)

I agree, the new Fiesta is an epic fail, see do understand that people want to sit and travel in cars not just children, the pathetically small back seats are not even good for teenagers let alone adults, the boot for the size of car is pathetic,
Overall Ford is pathetic.

Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"Sergiu-Lucian Petric? 
I am a Ford guy, drives a Fiesta and I agree with him in this aspect,
Ford Fiesta,Focus,Mondeo
All 3 have worst legroom for back seat passengers in its class, and despite pathetic back seat space their boots too are smaller, add to it they are not much shorter than competing cars makes them worst buy,
At this rate Ford is going to hit a wall in Europe, with VW,Skoda,Seat,Kia,Hyundai,Renault,Opel and now new Honda upping the game n Eurpope Ford will have to face seriosus business downfall and customers will hardly buy 2nd hand Fords because even in 2nd hand market rivals are better and this could spell Doom for Ford in Europe",6 years ago
Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"Sure, I agree that they're smaller. 
But worrying over boot space in a Fiesta is silly considering that it's a very small car to begin with. If you want a bigger car, buy a Focus. The Polo and Ibiza were upsized and people weren't happy about that. Matt said himself that the Polo isn't that much smaller than a Golf anymore, which again wasn't very well received by potential customers.  
Ford isn't going to hit a wall in Europe regarding size, the new Focus has a pretty big boot for example. I don't see why the Fiesta would have a big boot as well. About the Mondeo, I admit don't know that car very well but I agree that it should have a good boot and legroom. That's the whole point of that class.",6 years ago (edited)
Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"Sergiu-Lucian Petric? 
Well U really hav no idea..the new Polo and Ibiza are larger,but their prices are still in Fiesta, range, so that makes peope even more happy becuz they get a large car for small car price..
Has better boot space and more space means better comfort and do remember these cars sre road cars not rally cars, so handling wise Polo and Ibiza handling is more than enuf for majority of poeple..

No wonder VW sells 3 cars when Ford sells one and with Seat and Skoda combined,

VW sells 6 card in place of one Ford,
At this rate Ford will face serious issues..already they are blaming Brexit etc for losses..

Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"All right, first off you lost all credibility because you can't even decide whether VW sells 3 or 6 cars compared to 1 car for Ford. 
Secondly, you don't have a clue what you're talking about in either of those 2 cases: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_manufacturers_by_motor_vehicle_production#2016  
In 2016 Ford sold about 60% the amount the whole VAG group (that's 8 brands) sold. Why are you talking about stuff you have 0 idea about dude?  
The class above (Focus/Golf) is more expensive primarily because of better quality materials being used everywhere, size has much less to do with it. That's why the A1 for example is expensive yet small.  

If I had 20k EUR and wanted a city car I'd buy a Fiesta or a Polo, or something else in its class. I wouldn't buy a cheap SUV just because 'it's bigger so I get more with my money'. That makes no sense. If I wanted a bigger car I'd buy a Focus or a Golf, the price difference isn't even that big and you get more tech as standard anyway.

And what kind of argument is that, it's bullshit and it can work the other way around too. Toyota sold like 1/5th or less of what VW sold in Europe in 2017 yet globally it sells about as many cars as the entirety of VAG group. VAG being European sells the most cars in Europe, it's obvious. Toyota will sell more cars in Asia, again obvious, because it's a much better established name in that region.

Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"Sergiu-Lucian Petric? 
Then whats Ford.
Fords Fiesta,Focus,Mondeo, are Europe specific and are R&D in Europe and yet they are not able to make cars that have good space inside,boot space inside, quality as competitors..
I ma not comparing with VW but with others as well like Renault,PSA,Opel etc as well, they too make cars but have cars that give importance to car as a machine that can keep 4 in comfort unlike Ford thta makes cars for just driver and co passengers, the back seat users shud be midgets to be comfortable in a Ford, impractical boot designs, and the engines that nevet get anything close to advertised mileage ,
Its failure..

Fords European business is heavily under fall, the new Fiesta was something that could have saved them, but they messed it up big time,",6 years ago
Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"Many models are exported to the US as well, see the Mondeo and the Focus (not sure about Fiesta). The Ford Ranger is coming to Europe too. They're using both markets to complement each other which is a smart move.  
And NO manufacturer gives you a true mileage period. 
Also you've repeated the boot space argument once again. And I'm going to tell you again that the Focus has a big boot and good legroom in the back. As does the Mondeo, as much as you like lying again. Check Matt's Mondeo review and you'll see the legroom and boot are more than adequate.  
Once again, I invite you to inform yourself. The Fiesta is exactly what it needed to be. A sporty and fun small car, like it has been up until now. And it sold well.",6 years ago
Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"You realise that the only reason cars like the Polo and Ibiza are so spacious inside is because they are now huge outside too? New Polo is larger in every dimension than Mk2 Golf!
This trend for making each model larger than the last is getting silly, small cars are no longer small, so I actually applaud Ford for not increasing the dimensions of the car too much just because it is the industry trend. If you have a family and regularly carry people in the back then clearly the Fiesta is not for you, but for single people and couples (i.e the people it is aimed at) it is more than adequate.",6 years ago
Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"soundseeker63 
But being large outside or not, the Fiesta is crappy inside..
I mean should people sacrifice comfort in back seats just because of some brands stupid excuse that we have a small car..

See these smal dimensional changes ie around 5-8 cms difference is negligible compared to what space they offer inside 
Ford is stupid, still dosent k oe how to do interior packaging efficiently,

The Mondeo is a classic example, large outside but shitty Mondeo is smaller than a Jetta inside,...pathetic Ford engineers",6 years ago
Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"It is largely irrelevant because nobody who buys a Fiesta uses it to ferry adults about in the back. In fact I can't recall having ever seen rear passengers in a Fiesta apart from school kids.  I've not been in the new Mondeo so can't comment on that, but I found the old one to be fine and I am 6'2 so I doubt it is as bad as you say.",6 years ago
Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"soundseeker63 
Old Mondeo was good new one is shit.
Old Focus was fine, 2011-2018 Focus is worse  than 2006-2010 Focus.

See my point is, if you make a back seat, make a proper back seat, Ford always does this does pathetic back seats...like all people buying cars have just 2 adults and 2 kids that too sub 5 foor kid s,

See even teenage kids nowadays are 6 feet tall..

No wonder Ford is going downhill in Europe,",6 years ago
Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"Man, you seriously need to stop speaking if you don't know what you're talking about. 

The MK3 (I'm not even talking MK3.5) Focus is better than the MK2.5 Focus in every possible respect minus boot space. It's more reliable, better inside, more comfortable, handles better, and has tons more options. I know this because my family has owned both cars.  

The new Fiesta is anything but bad inside, at this point I'm starting to think you're a cheap troll. You didn't even have the common sense to watch this video you're commenting on.  

And like soundseeker63 said, the new Polo is very big, too big for its class. The Polo GTI is heavier than a manual MK7 Golf GTI. Heavier than a car a whole fucking class above it!  
The Fiesta kept its size, like it should. Why would anybody want a bigger Fiesta when they can just buy a Focus?  

Once again your arguments are laughable.",6 years ago (edited)
Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"Sergiu-Lucian Petric? 
Then explain why Polo is outselling Fiesta 4 to 1,
See people look at options and if one can get a car in Fiesta range pricing but with way better space and comfort, they will choose it over the small Cramped Fiesta.

See my point is, if you make a back seat, make a proper one,not one thats handicapped.

The VW, Skoda,Seat,RENAULT,NISSAN, all have done this..look the competition and its back seats..its only Ford thats lagging behind, and at least from my point the MK III Focus had the worst back seats ever for a C segment hatch back, it was too pathetic and I felt the MK II had better space inside even boot was better",6 years ago

http://carsalesbase.com/european-car-sales-data/ford/ford-fiesta/ 

Are you a pathological liar, or are you simply not smart enough to check your own facts before making a point?  

The Renault Clio and the Peugeot 208 are other superminis with small boot capacities. So you're lying about Renault's boot space too, because your reality is different than the rest of us.  
Those cars are also selling very well - just like the Fiesta is actually. Do you know why they're selling? Because people who buy superminis don't fucking care about boot space. They want a reasonably small city car that's nippy and fun to drive. 
What VW offers instead is a large and boring as cock Polo which nobody asked for. That's why so far in 2018 the Fiesta is selling more than the Polo is in Europe. The Clio is also outselling the shit out of the Polo.

The 2 cars in this video actually seem like cars best avoided if you are looking for decent value and low running costs. I personally would never consider spending close to ¡ê20k on cars like these. Of the 2 I'd choose the Polo though because of the Ford's faster depreciation in the UK and also seems a lot of problems with Ford Eco-boost engines that is quite off-putting. I would also point out that having a nice dashboard and doors that make a pleasing solid noise when closed is not a true indicator of build quality. A car that is made to tight tolerances and has fantastic long term reliability not just within the warranty period is a true sign of fantastic build quality and something the Japanese generally do best hence why the cost of owning such cars is often much more lower than owning German cars nowadays.",5 years ago

Volkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,"yes but that only happened on the first generation ecoboosts as they didn't give it a strong enough head gasket. They have made the later ones with stronger gaskets and also better turbos so the issues are basicly not there anymore. the ecoboost engines now compared to the first ones they made may look similar but most of the parts have been tweaked and redesigned. the engine has been out for a good 7 years or so I wouldn't say its something you need to worry about anymore.
However with that said I do drive a fiest 1.0 ecoboost myself. had it for two years and as its the 100ps version it has a power dip at around 1600 rpm which is a rev range you will always find yourself in. Will not buy a three cylinder engine ever again, they are unbalanced and none can fix it unless they add another cylinder to balance it out. 4 cylinders or more are the way to go.",3 years ago

Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"Sergiu-Lucian Petric? individuals will have their preferences for sure, But class leader simply means over all, the polo does the most right in its class. 
Yes the fiesta is a brilliant little car to drive and looks decent and is good value for money but the polo isn't that much more expensive on average across the range, imo better interior quality, more space, more brand appeal, Arguably better looking, Better range of engines.
 No dissing going on here the polo is the better car.",6 years ago
Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"But like you said, the class leader gets most points right or at least close to right. The Polo and Seat were upsized compared to the last generation which gives them slightly more space compared to the Fiesta, yes.  
On the other hand the Polo completely misses the fun to drive factor, and in such a car this is important. This is a car for young people and is one of the reasons I think VW did the wrong thing by upsizing the Polo to such a degree. Even Matt said it's pretty close to the Golf. 

You could totally debate the fun to drive factor in a car from the Passat's class for example, being a more popular class for middle aged (and above) people perhaps comfort is more important. 
But the Polo class is popular among young people, and the fun factor is important.",6 years ago (edited)

Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"Sergiu-Lucian Petric? If you had taken some time to do some research, Hyundai has been using an ever evolving design language known as fluidic sculpture, a design language which has been completely original from the inside out. Similarly, Kia has its own tiger nose grille with other shared design features amongst models. 

The head of design for most of the modern Kias and Hyundais was originally head of design for Audi and BMW, something Ford could never claim to have",6 years ago

Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"Clement you can justify the design evolution in a thousand different ways, but the last 2 generations of the i30 had a very similar front end to the MK3 and MK3.5 Focus. That's the end result.  
Right now the backs from Hyundais, Kias, Fords, Mercedeses and even BMWs all look similar. It doesn't matter if you can justify it by an evolution. They all look the same and it's silly, it's boring. Feels like they've all started copying each other.",6 years ago

Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"I mean you have to be a special kind of dotard to say either a Kia or Hyundai are great cars. They have reliability and customer support on their side, but they¡¯re known for having shite driving dynamics with almost every reviewer saying the steering is shit on all but higher end models like Stinger, and the interior quality is just far worse than inside a Ford, the plastics used on the dash and for switches is just so flimsy and cheap. This isn¡¯t even my opinion, step inside and see for yourself, it¡¯s a fact that you can observe for yourself.",6 years ago
Ford Fiesta 2020 detailed in-depth review | carwow Reviews,"Adam Burns Well, having owned an i30 and a BMW X3, I think I have the credibility to make accurate comparisons of interiors. For that, Hyundai and Kia make interiors which are definitely up to scratch with those we see in Japanese and European brands. A little more than 10 years ago and I would have agreed with you, but times have changed and its really time to bin the attitude that Korean cars are less capable of making a good of a car as Europe and Japan. Sure, driving dynamics are still just that miniscule bit behind but I can tell you they really are storming ahead.

FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"Just a word of advice to whoever reads this. Buy your 2010-2020 fiesta or focus in a manual! It does matter what model it is. The automatic transmissions built in fiestas and focuses were built with clutches not torque converters. In simple terms the car¡¯s computer will guess which gear to select, disconnect the transmission from the engine, switch gears, reconnect the transmission with the engine, and then it prays to god that you aren¡¯t slowing down or going up a hill because that¡¯s when gears start to get  grind . You can notice this when your slowing driving walking speed because you¡¯ll feel a chattering effect. A Ford dealership had to  replace two transmissions and on a separate occasion they had do a transmission re-programming for my gf.  I told her to return the car since we only drove it for 28,000 miles. Luckily the dealership took it back and we were going to take the money and look at suvs but then I also remembered that ford doesn¡¯t know how to make proper transfer cases. The real reason why fiestas are being pulled is because of a drunk engineer that thought it was a good idea to mix manual and automatic parts together. The 2010-2020 focuses have the same problems but they have been in the American market for decades so they have a reputation but if Ford keeps putting these type of transmissions in focuses they will also get pulled from the production line. It¡¯s not just one car btw. I always here other people also  bitching and moaning about how their focus/fiesta/and (sometimes) fusion have these crappy transmissions.",4 years ago

Ford Fiesta Shopping Centre Chase | Top Gear | BBC,"The budget isn't that crazy considering they were test driving one of the cheapest American cars in production at the time. A car like this rented for $11 a day back then. Today, maybe $45.

Aside from the Nissan Versa, the Ford Fiesta is probably the closest you can get to a street legal go kart.

I had one of these cars in the early 2000s and if you're driving on a populated island like England, sure, it's feasible.

But on American highways? Absolutely not. This was a car owned by folks who lived in the backwoods or country areas where speed limits rarely exceed 55mph. Very popular in the northeast United States but you'd rarely see anyone else owning one for their daily commute. Simply not enough power to enter a highway on ramp safely anywhere except the colonial states. 

This car would be a death trap in the south with their 80mph speed limits on interstates",3 years ago (edited)

On the other hand: transmission problems. And THREE door latch recalls, what the hell Ford. I am very bitter about the $900 I spent on new door latches--even if Ford did reimburse me after the latest recall.

But almost all of the VW cars use the same engines variety and gear boxes.

Looks like a smaller-sized Golf, and you only notice the smaller size when you get the two of them together, while the Fiesta looks like... well, it looks like what it is.

FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"?@maybelive765? There are also a lot of ways to define ""average"" here, so I'm not sure that's entirely false. Like, are we weighting it by sales, a la ([HP of Car 1][Units of Car 1 Sold] + ... + [HP of Car N][Units of Car N Sold])/[Total Cars Sold], or are we not weighting it by sales and just averaging the HP on the sticker for each model on sale? A similar question is whether this average applies to all new cars sold in 2019 or specifically cars from the 2019 model year. You made a good point too about whether we're leaving out certain kinds of vehicles or not.

Volkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,"Andrew Fresen - Faster Health because you can't freely compare a practical car to a fun car and objectively put a winner forward. The cars are just too different.  

Practicality isn't subjective, you're right - but not everybody cares about it. I don't for example, I'm alone or have +1 passenger in my car 99% of the time while my boot is either empty or has a rucksack in it because I travel light. I'm much more interested in how fun a car is.  

On top of that, the Polo is plain bigger - it's stretching the limits of the Supermini class by being bigger than a MK4 Golf. It's almost as big as a MK7 Golf, Mat even made the initial Polo review with the headline 'Do you really need a Golf?'.  

My point is that picking a winner isn't so easy when comparing these cars because of the size difference. Not only that, but it's also about comfort vs sportiness. Imo it's odd that Mat even picked a winner instead of saying something like 'you want fun, get Fiesta - you want practicality, get Polo'.",5 years ago

Volkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,Seat Ibiza. Ford's practicality is poor and would not really work as my only car. Great 2nd car. Quite expensive for a 2nd car. I don't like the Polo's looks. Very dull. Ibiza looks sharper and quality not that much worse. I had one as courtesy car and enjoyed it. Was sad to give it back. I like the destinctive sound of the little 1 litre 3 cylinder. Much more interesting than a 4 and smoother at higher revs. 4s get harsh when revved. 3s get loud but not unpleasant. I'd spec my Ibiza quite highly as the base model I had looked cheap inside as everything was grey. Not the case in models further up the range. VW should try harder to make it's cars look smarter and more interesting. The T Roc is more like it. Allow custom roof and stuff to make it stand out.,5 years ago

Volkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,Owned a seat Leon. 2 of them. 1st one a 1.2tsi se which was actually less new than either of these. Then a 1.4tsi se. Good car. Reliable up to 4 years then I got turbo actuator failure (fixed under extended warranty in less than a day) and a flat battery. Complexity of these concerns me a bit. All these small turbo's have lots more to break. They both did 45mpg which makes what the fiesta did on this video seem rubbish as this is bigger car. The 1.4 was also downright quick. The interiors a bit dull but solid and the drive is nice. Ride a bit firm but I expect no worse than these two,5 years ago

Volkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,"?@StereotypedFilms? Ecoboost has less Problems than VW TSI or TFSI... so an Ecoboost is to prefer

In Germany VW is famous for a lack of engine quality. Mechanics in germany hate on VW. Their engones completly coke, the intake valves coke and lose compression. The timing belt expands after a few thousand kilometers, get loud and need quick exchange.
VW even admitted this fault and recalled all TSI engines and changed them in warranty. Their injectors fail extremely often ect.
There are german car mechanics youtube channels almost only covering VW repairs and are pissed at how bad these engines are because they destroy themselves in arounr 100k kilometers.

VW even advices to clean cylinder heads with walnut shells after 100.000ish kilometers to asure the engine works properly.

Ecoboost has none of those problems. Ecoboost might have little problems. But better a few little problems than one massive problem in form of a whole engine.


Wow, all this blind stupid hate against Ford engines. They aren`t engine of the year several times for no reason.
But this happens when non mechanics idiots read some bullshit on the internet.

And i agree with @UCvKK2VmaDvhYV9NIYRJdXOw. Ford probably sells massively more fiestas than VW does polos at least in germany in my region.

Volkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,"?@edgimson5706? No VW build quality is garbage, if it was so good then why do their DSG gearboxes fail so early. This is the same company that made the Beetle a barebones economy car. People need to stop treating VW as a luxary badge.",5 years ago
Volkswagen Polo 2019 vs Ford Fiesta 2019 - see which is the best small car! | carwow,"?@1001speedster? the gear boxes are incredibly reliable? The early S tronic gearboxes in Audis weren't fantastic because they failed at around 100k miles but with a ford I don't think you expect anything to last that long do you? 
The DSG gearboxes are pretty bulletproof.
The beetle was a bare bones economy car yes... 70years ago, and it's the only car you still see on the road except a camper van (also VW). 
I don't think anyone treat VW as a premium badge because it's not one.  There are plenty of cars that are, but what VW does have in common with those brands (and very very commonly beats them in terms of) is resale value because people know that the second and third owner can expect the same reliability that the first did. 
That said there are plenty of good cheaper options, like the Skoda and Seat, or even an Up! but the only non VAG car that I think can match VAG's quality is possibly Honda but they've done everything they can to make their cars flamboyant and modern but in doing so making them age terribly, which is a shame. 
French alternatives are pretty and drive well, I like the DS3 and the 209 but theyre  just not going to last or retain even 50% of their value in the first 3yrs.",5 years ago

Won't lie, my Focus ST drinks fuel, the miles per gallon is terrible, if i do a 40-50 mile drive in a lot of cases that's 1/4 of a tank gone.

People just wanna hate on fiesta because they are fanboys or they just dont like it. But they are clueless and spread lies to make fun.
The truth is, a VW will break down earlier due to the famous problems of VW engines coking, timing chain expanding, loss of compression ect. VW even needed to recall all their TSI modells because they failed.
With a VW you can be sure you will need serious engine rework at some point. Only option than is to sell it used to a clueless idiot and buy a new car.

Ford Fiesta Shopping Centre Chase | Top Gear | BBC,"Polished marble has a friction coefficient of approx 0.2. A fiesta weighs 1570 kg GVW. Put that into our equation

f=(0.2)(1570) 
f=314 kg
Friction exerted on vehicle is 314 kg, provides just enough friction. Combined with medium torque, you can go forth.

Corvette:
f=(0.2)(1598)
f=319.6
About the same, but the toque applied is higher. Low friction exerted with high torque means wheel spin

FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"?@shona5512? Ok so answer this front-wheel-drive person. And I'm assuming Rally trained.?? You are at a Red light getting ready to make a 90-degree left turn. No police to your left or right. In the rear view mirror nothing in sight. Streets are empty.  I'll even help you out and call it rainy. Green arrow appears. You would have had to have a running start at the light to do your Lift-Off oversteer. From a dead stop how are you going to bring the backend out besides having McDonald's trays and the e-brake pulled ? With front-engine rear-drive, you don't even have to pop the clutch. As you go into the turn just hit the pedal on the right and fun begins. I don't want to wait halfway down the street and hope the light turns green so I can fly in and Lift-Off oversteer. And then what if you get a bunch of understeer. you have to have the proper suspension in the proper front wheel drive car to do it. you can take any rear wheel drive and kick it out.",4 years ago

It still gets on average 23 mpg, down to 18 if I¡¯m being super super routy with it. Tires are reasonably cheap at 220 per for 4S¡¯s (tire + install). It¡¯s easy to work on and all the parts are cheap. It¡¯s fast enough to have fun, but slow enough to keep you out of trouble from the CHP (but can easily break 100). You can throw it around corners at speed, and 3-wheel it pulling into a gas station, making people go ¡°wtf¡± every-time.

Its not.

No. Space is beyond the atmosphere when you are dealing with rockets. Otherwise you using a term that is not related to rocketry. The reliant was within space-time since it came off the assembly line.

As you did, fool. So Euripides managed to get something right.

Again idiot. It was a imitation SPACE SHUTTLE. It clearly was not going to go very far and they likely had explosives set to go off when it hit the ground. 

THEY knew it would not reach SPAAACE but you are to stupid to understand any of that. So dumb you think that CLOSET space is the correct context for a ROCKET.

They're incredibly cheaply made; The interior is shit. You can't actually drive one of them without going to the hospital to get your spine put back into place; The ride is shit.

I can list ten-fifteen cars that are not only comparable, or even better, but are significantly cheaper. You buy a piece of garbage for $55k when you could buy:

BMW 3 ($32k)
BMW 5 (Luxurious, and fast: $50k)
BMW Z4 ($50k)
Mercedes SLK (Luxurious, and fast: $47k)
Audi A5 ($40k, or get the Cabriolet for $47k)
Audi A6 (Incredibly luxurious and sporty: $46k)
And don't even get me started on the fun small cars

Mazda Mx-5 Miata ( $24k Incredibly fun)
Mazda6 ($21k Gorgeous car)
Subaru BRZ ($25k)
Subaru WRX ($26k)
Or if you just want the feel of an American muscle with a roaring engine:
Mustang ($32k for the V8, AND you can actually use it as a daily use car)

Drives a little like a MX5 (same motor as the early Miata and I had one of them for 200,000 miles).  As I drive I see several of them any day.  Retailed for $12,000 US + tax (6% for me).  I bought mine from a Ford dealer in immaculate condition, one year old + some miles, $8100 + 500 tax.  Beat that for a dealer ready, nearly new car overseas.

Base model, good 5sp stick, AC, stereo, roll up crank windows (love it).  It handles much like in this skit. Good little cheapo car.  I sold my e36 and bought this.  I like this better.  Good little car for a tall guy.  High roof.",6 years ago

FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,How far did you work the script ?,4 years ago
FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"Honestly, man, sometimes, to get the most viewership and to open up the most possible newcomers to something unusual, you have to get a bit more Hollywood than you might get from a documentary. I say it¡¯s a brilliant idea, whether it ends up being more cinematic, or realistic.",4 years ago
FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"?@archfxt3619? Not far at all. I never cracked a code. I did not want to go the ""Rivalry"" rout. They are great, but its not always as easy for lesser known events in the world. Did not know which team to make the main one. It was either going to be Mitsubishi or Subaru. I did want to make the idea tour Europe, in terms of not one setting. Maybe start in the UK, end in Athens. I could not find the right hook. The only ""Famous"" rally car movie I know is the French 60s film ""A man and a woman"" and that is like 80% romance and 20% rally driving in a Mustang. Not even a rally movie at all.",4 years ago
FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,?@thejay8963? True. But I wanna make it a good idea and not something "Nice and shiny" to get money. I write other ideas for that. I wanted this to be something special to capture some of the European love for this sport.,4 years ago
FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,?@gutz1981? make it an underdog story ? Or how about a " strict racer slowly realising his passion to drive and not only win " sort a thing ?,4 years ago
FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"?@archfxt3619? I would like to do a ""Father/Son"" legacy film. Son follows in his father's footsteps but is his own worst enemy. Again, too Hollywood. Maybe make the son ""Claustrophobic"" after crashing in a car with his father years ago and he was trapped in the car for like a day and night with his dead father which he caused to die and was trapped in with him and how he is always prone to panic attacks when he is strapped inside the car when he races yet drives through it and doesn't tell anyone.",4 years ago (edited)
FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"?@gutz1981? but you gotta remember , some movies that are consudered cukt status have a really shitty plot , but the cinematography makes up for it , a movie that goes in deep with close up 1 take shot of actual drivibg without music would be the john wick of racing movies , with racing lines that is coherrent like a choreography and one take feel",4 years ago
FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"?@archfxt3619? As mentioned, I might make it a ""Father/son"" story. Start the film late at night were we see a teenager trapped upside down in a car after it has crashed and he is stuck looking at his dead father he accidentally ""killed"" while training and he is trapped for a day or so. And the kid grows up with a massive phobia of being trapped and he is prone to panic attacks when he is driving. But WHY does he still drive and how does it work into him wanting to be a racer? I think of his character like Charles Bronson in Great Escape. He is the best digger because he has claustrophobia and digs hard because he HAS to get out. How to make that into a rally movie, I have no idea.",4 years ago
FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"?@gutz1981? oh nice , also make it so that he thinks that he's trapped in a metal box , but actually he's free to roam with his car - also his father should be a very struct driver that is skilled but has almost no "" feel "" of the car , so he learnt not to be like his father , and instead also rely on his feelings , it can also be mixed in with old vs new thing , where he's at the start more comfortavle with the newer cars but ended uo finding that technology restricts him , then again its your story , have fun pal",4 years ago

FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"?@archfxt3619? Yeah, one day I will crack it. I may also have it revealed in a flashback he actually DID kill his father. In terms when he was training his father had low respect for his son, so he actually crashed the car on purpose not knowing it would actually kill his father. Sorta like a ""Sudden swerve to shut him up"" type thing.",4 years ago

FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"gutz1981 as long as you cater to the audience u want (car guys) the movie will do well. throw in a bunch of lingo and stereotypes from the car community without making it cheesy and throw in some iconic cars. dont forget about how rally is a two person sport, the driver and the guy who tells him the turns and whatever. you could create an interedting relationship between the driver and his partner. actually thats a really good idea ahaha",4 years ago
FORD FIESTA - Everything You Need to Know | Up to Speed,"gutz1981 
Ah. See, I like that, but I really think more Americans should learn about the sport, and the bit of Hollywood-ing might make it more engaging. Also, considering how visceral the sport is by it¡¯s nature, you really wouldn¡¯t need to add too much HW garbage to keep viewers engaged.",4 years ago

It did run decently afterward though, the thing that killed it was a quite unrelated thrown rod a good deal further down the road.

Naturally I'd like to avoid the situation entirely but considering it is a possibility given my area's hurricane-prone nature it would actually be very useful to know if the Fiesta is a bit hardier than its older, slightly larger cousin.",10 years ago

The grass is not always greener on the other side.? I prefer not having to pay respect to any Queen, or King in my nation.? Hell, I don't even really have to like, or respect the president.? When it comes to Top Gear US vs. British versions, I happen to know each version outside of those two are unique in their own right (Top Gear Australia, Russia, Korea, etc).? It's based on market.? But unfortunately, BBC America introduced us to the UK version first, and we liked it more, even though a lot of the cars discussed on the UK version are not even available in the USA.? That's another thing.? We like seeing cars we can't get, and the best way to do that is to watch the UK version of the show.? I think the problem with the USA version and why it tanked was because it targeted a specific age group, whereas the UK version targets virtually all ages, and is reflected by the cast and their personalities.",9 years ago
