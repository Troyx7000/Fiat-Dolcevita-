Also, at 100 kmh you are at 2500 or more RPM. When trying to accelerate you are faced with the following dilemma: either no acceleration: or b: hit the rev limiter. This car is so annyoing!

I&#39;ve had a 500 hybrid for about 2 years now, and I&#39;m very happy with it. As you say, it&#39;s not very punchy on the motorway but it&#39;s not what it&#39;s been designed to do in the first place (the Abarth would fix that). I&#39;m 5&#39;6 and the steering is on the left - meaning that my left foot can rest on the side unlike the right hand drive - worth pointing out. It&#39;s cheap to buy, cheap to run because to compensate for the &quot;punch&quot; it&#39;s not using up much petrol, it&#39;s very easy to park, it&#39;s fun to drive, and if I&#39;d had a penny for every time someone told me how beautiful it is, I&#39;d be a millionaire by now! I&#39;ve had 2 minor incidents with it. The first one when a tree branch crashed on the bonnet as I was driving (I&#39;d have preferred winning the lottery on the odds of that!!) and I&#39;ve had to replace the part - my insurance covered it. 2nd incident more recently: a deer ran across the road as I was driving at 50 mph on a country road and I could not avoid it. I hit it. Damage? luckily no other car was around me, and I didn&#39;t brake hard or veered off the road - it stayed well put on the tarmac as I slowly stopped the car. The bumper took all the shock, and moved very slightly. The pieces of chrome smashed, but none of the lights were broken. The part that holds up the radiator broke too, but that was it. I didn&#39;t even claim it on insurance because it didn&#39;t cost much to fix. As for the deer, it escaped!! It carried on running and I never saw it again - so I guess it survived. This experience taught me that it&#39;s actually a very secure tough little car as well as being cute, cheap and fun.', 'I have a 2015 convertible here in the states. Automatic.  I believe 1.4 ltr.  I love it for what it is.  I had a 2012  5 speed which was much quicker and much better mpg.  Auto mpg tops out at only 27 mpg.  But I still love it.

mean I take some hair for a start but anyway the Fiat 500 has been a runaway sales success since it came back in 2007 thanks in part to looking like it driven straight off a Milan catwalk for cars so today I want to find out if the fit 500 is multo Bene or if you shouldn't touch it with a soiled Gondola stick is that a thing it's probably not the right word for it anyway let's go [Music] now I know it's deeply unstylish to talk about money but the Fiat 500 is an affordable car it costs from less than 15 000 pounds for a brand new one and we've got loads in stock here at modest point for under 10 grand so it makes sense as a first car secondly there's a new all-electric version of the Fiat 500 which is very good but it's also very thirty thousand pounds it's horrifically expensive so we're not talking about that today just the regular petrol version the Fiat 500 trades on its looks no way that I could only dream of frankly and that's because it draws inspiration from the iconic Fiat Cinque gentle from the late 1950s it's a warm and cuddly and friendly like Dory from Finding Nemo whereas something like Audi A1 is more like the aggressive sharks that are going through fish eating rehab that friendliness also extends to parking look how small it is it's only 3.6 meters long if you want a smaller car than this and frankly you're going to have to get a smart car or just get a motorbike and cut your losses it's even got a little button on the dashboard that you can prod to make the steering super light for herb Urban parking Maneuvers I think that's what that is [Music] the Fiat 500's onslaught of style continues here in the cabin where it just looks very nice however it does feel a little bit plasticky because it is an affordable car you're gonna get that this is a limited edition Dolce Vita model it gets black and white two-tone seats which are nice but also make you think like you're sitting on a killer whale there isn't anything killer about this car's technology you've got quite a basic instrument cluster you've got the speed around the outside the revs in the middle you get a seven inch touchscreen for entertainment on everything but the entry level model and you can plug your phone in to use Apple carplay or Android auto on that so you don't have to use Fiat Sat Nav you can use Google Maps on your phone hooray you've also got quite a lot of storage for a small car I've got a nice handy phone bin down here with some USBS next to it so I can charge my phone I've got two little cup holders I've got okay sized door bins and on this one I've got a nice sunroof as well to let some of that lovely Peterborough winter lighting one thing that's not so good at storing though is humans in the back seats as we're about to find out at the cost of my dignity when I thought I'd be reviewing a Fiat 500 I kind of saw myself cruising around the streets of Florence eating pastries and pizzas and pasta instead I'm jammed in the back like a sardine in a cold bit of pizza it's really not great back here for adults it has got ice effects on the outer seats but if your child seat has a leg on it it's really not gonna fit there's also a mild Hybrid battery underneath the passenger seat which has got a big sticker on it saying don't put your feet on this box so you can't you're not even allowed to put your feet under the seats it's awful yeah you knew that but here's a six foot three board man showing you why it's bad [Music] I've just realized the fuel filler needs the key to unlock it that's very old-fashioned now around the back of the Fiat 500 the stylish Serenity is spoiled by a lie this hybrid badge is not really a hybrid it's a mild hybrid so it's got an integrated starter generator motor which helps the engine cut out when you're coasting and it helps you reduce your emissions when you're starting up it's not a proper hybrid it cannot drive on electric power alone but anyway let's talk about the boot space it's actually pretty decent for a small car 185 liters of stuff will fit in here it's a nice wide opening we're going to do a big boot Challenge in a second but look the rear seats fold down 50 50 to give you a much bigger space 550 liters the only downside then is you've got this big lip here so you can't slide stuff all the way in but it's pretty good and it wins the award for the cutest little parcel shelf ever but is it cuter than the motor Point big boot challenge no it's not nothing is [Music] yes the fit 500 has failed the big boot challenge but I'm still a bit disappointed I can't even close the boot with one big bag in there because there's no cut out in the inside of this boot card here but anyway I know most people are only going to use the Fiat 500 as a two-seater so I'm going to put the back seats down and try again in our first ever big boot challenge the sequel take two [Music] right we cheated a bit but like pushy parents for some after school GCSE tutoring we got the 500 a pass so if you are going to do an airport run with you and one other person and two big bags and two small bags you'll still have some room to spare if you fold the back seats down but what won't be cheating is our analysis of the Fiat 500's composure out on the public roads which is where we're going now [Music] all right let's go for a drive now little Fiat 500 and the first thing you notice when you get in is for a tall person I'm six foot three the driving position is a little bit weird I've got to sit quite close my legs are bent up but then my arms are stretched out it's very Italian the steering wheel only goes up and down it doesn't adjust in and out otherwise yeah this should be fairly easy to drive the view out all around is pretty good if you've got the 500c that's the ragtop convertible it's not really a convertible the roof just bunches up at the back that can limit visibility out the back a little bit when the roof is down or folding it back in terms of engines you've got very few choices nowadays in the UK this is the one liter mild hybrid version which is a naturally aspirated that means non-turbo charged three cylinder petrol with 70 horsepower it should get you about 53 MPG and it's obviously not especially fast older versions get a 1.2 liter petrol which has similar power to this a little bit less efficient and a little bit less fun and then there's a 0.9 turbocharged version in the older versions as well called the Twitter and that was really good really Punchy but it's quite hard to find these days even at most point right we're going to get on some dual carriageways and talk about refinement at Motorway speeds just as it starts to rain on the motorway speeds in the Fiat 500 and it took a little while to get here to be frank it's not very fast but refinement is kind of what you expect from a small car I've got a reasonable amount of wind noise mostly from the roof and if you get the 500c convertible my experience that lets in quite a lot of wind noise even when the roof is shut MPG as I've said getting about 53 safety we should talk about it's only got a three star Euro end cap rating from 2017. general safety was okay but it hasn't got lots of the electronic safety tape like automatic emergency braking Lane keeping assist none of that's even an option so it lost a few Stars but that does mean it can be more expensive than you might think to ensure especially if you're buying it is your first car so it's just something to be aware of otherwise well it's okay for long Journeys you wouldn't really dread them but there are better cars for it such as a mini but anyway we're going to head out on some country roads and see if it's fun to drive right we're on a country road now in the Fiat 500 and this is quite a bumpy road and it does just again feel like a small car it's a little bit jiggly it's a little bit unsettled it's not uncomfortable it just you wouldn't want to do a long bumpy drive in it in terms of handling though it's not quite as fun as a mini to drive but it's certainly got that nippiness and it just really wants to live at home in the city darting in and out of traffic so yeah it's not a car you would drive quickly down a country road having lots of fun but it's okay it is fine look it's a corner coming up the brakes they're fine it's gonna use the word fine quite a lot and around we go I don't want to go around there any faster than that especially if it's raining but yeah really so home in town but that said you can do Motorway Journeys and reasonable Comfort it's kind of what you expected probably but anyway let's go back to motor point for an outro foreign [Music] 500 is a compromised car it's not the most comfortable thing it's not at home on the motorway especially and parts of it feel quite cheap but that's the thing it is an affordable car and it is a very stylish one it's kind of one of those cars that you know if you want one you want one and nothing else will do and as long as you can accept those compromises and the fact it hasn't got some of the latest safety Tech then well go and get one Grazie Miller for watching this video if it's been helpful please hit like

here's a little tour around the vehicle just one thing i wanted to tell you guys i'm actually five foot ten i know that helps a lot of people when they're watching reviews of this tiny little compact car because a lot of people think if you're tall this won't be the car for you but i'm really happy with it and i'm not exactly sure [Music] okay so some of you might know me as amy the fairy and that's why you're watching this others of you might just be wanting to see a fiat 500 dolce vita car tour so i decided to do this one because when i was getting this car i couldn't find any um car tours in the uk or really just in general of the dolce vita model and so i thought yeah when mine comes i'll do it this is a dolce vita standard by the way unfortunately right now i could not afford the dolce vita plus but she's still beautiful and yeah i'm really really happy with her she arrived today let's look at everything i love all the chrome the black and the chrome looks so good i'm loving these 15-inch alloy wheels let's go around the back she is of course a hybrid now she's only a mild hybrid which means um she charges up as you are breaking and accelerating and in neutral all that kind of stuff you know but basically the battery is used to support the petrol system i love this as well the 500 there um as when you're under 30 miles an hour this is the boot it's actually quite a decent size um i wasn't expecting this is a tripod which i was potentially going to use to film today just a bag full of other bags because in the uk you have to pay for shopping bags and that is not the one you could definitely fit like a large suitcase in here and obviously the seats do go down as well and then i've got some shoes just in case i'm ever out in non-driving appropriate shoes so that's just a shot of the car through here the reason i decided to go for the black as well is because it has black and white seeds i thought that it was nice for everything the whole thing to just be black chrome and white just monochrome and it just looks really cool so this is the inside it's the black colorway um you got your black leather wrapped steering wheel with all your controls on it got the fiat badge and yes i did paint my nails specifically to match that for this video what i absolutely love are these black and let's say off-white leather seats they're actually so comfy and they look so nice um and i got these floor mats for it they don't fit perfectly because they're from amazon but they were only 22 pounds so i highly recommend those i'll put a link in the description section for anybody looking for floor mats obviously there are two back seats but really this is not a car that i would take lots of passengers on um but it's fine for short journeys and for children i've got some hooks here to hang my coat on and stuff while i'm driving the speakers in the back there um i'm just going to sit in to show you the rest so one thing i really did want when i was looking for a car was an electronic speedo which this one unfortunately does not have but i find with the fiat 500 because the speedometer is so big and clear it doesn't affect me too much even though i'm used to an electronic one this is quite cool you've got your chrome handle here and you just click that in and your car is locked um my keys are in here but obviously i would need to plug them in to start the ignition which i will do to show you some cool stuff i have a little side compartment here just for sunglasses a must when you're driving then here we have two usb ports this connects your phone to the screen which is here which i'll show you in a minute i love this like sparkly interior what i love about the fit 500 is so funky and cool um and retro and it's just kept its style over the years which is cute i also have this panoramic panoramic sunroof cute right [Music] but it does get very hot in here i'm not gonna lie i'm boiling until you get the aircon on it boils and then down there i just have um it's another big compartment for stuff but that's just got hand sanitizer in an absolute must um and that's the other door yes uh it's got six speeds and then you have to lift up for reverse which is another thing i have to get used to because my other car has five these are the windows so it's a bit different they're not on your side panel they're here in the middle this is like your aircon system hun that is your emergency lights or hazard warning lights this is for city steering now i don't think i'll ever use this because the steering is so light on these cars anyway but that's what that is um so yeah let me just show you when i turn on the car also look how cute the key is like everything just matches perfectly when you get it in black like everything's black chrome white and then maroon so my other car i don't actually have to plug in to turn on but whatever so you go like this and then the screen comes on which is just like adorable you'll see it in a second and it powers up and i can't plug my phone in right now um oh my god thank goodness the aircon is kicking in because um i'm filming on it but yeah my phone would connect to that i love like the seating position in the 500 is so good it almost it basically feels like you're in an suv it's got a nice big windscreen you can really see high up over the dash which i absolutely love that's a real plus of this car here you can see the speedo unfortunately this digital panel in the middle cannot show how fast you're going and i think it's a bit silly to be honest because people would still upgrade to the plus even if you let us have a really crappy looking basic looking digital speedo there because that whole light up panel is really attractive and people would still upgrade so i think it's unfair they could have easily put an electronic speedo there but i'm trying not to focus on that because that is the one thing i am really missing in this car um it's so zippy guys like it's ridiculous like i feel like it goes so fast um and there you can see on the right hand side you have the battery uh charge and on the left you have how much petrol you've got guys that was basically a really basic car tool of me and my car and i feel like you might want to see me drive it something to note the dolce vita does not have a built-in sat nav however it does come with apple carplay as standard and it's really easy to use [Music] okay guys so i actually put 60 miles on the clock yesterday um and that made me realize that there's a few extra things i want to mention that i forgot to mention i don't think i mentioned the gear stick position but most people mention that in their 500 videos but it's there instead of like sort of down here um i also didn't show you the glove compartment like this glove compartment glove this glove compartment is really spacious i actually have an suv as well and it doesn't have as much room in it as this glove compartment i've got so much stuff in there like some wipes to keep it clean a cloth some extra lightning charges a notebook the like service book and everything so and there's still like loads of room so that's really good and the wheel nut lock i love this little 500 logo as well that's so cute that's so glittery you can't really tell how glittery it is but it's really glittery um so i didn't mention that another thing to know is that the dolce vita actually has um six speakers instead of four um so there's two in the front and then one in the back as well and after driving a lot yesterday there's me hey um the sound system in here is actually really really good like it's so clear and it sounds really nice when you're driving um which i wasn't i was expecting it to be a bit i don't know cheaper sounding but it sounds good also this screen really super easy to use it's in a really good position when you're driving you barely have to take your eyes off the road to look at it so that's really good the screen's great um i've added some extra mirrors to my mirror these are called blind spot mirrors i use them for parking i don't really use them to look at my blind spot obviously but i use them for parking because when they're out they show that you're in the lines they're really good one negative i guess the steering wheel this is only adjustable up and down it is not adjustable in reach so i actually do feel like a little bit because i've got long legs being five foot ten yeah um like i have to be further away from the pedals but then i feel like my arm is quite far away from the steering wheel uh so that is not ideal might be a feel a bit far away from the this as well but it might just be something i have to get used to um because i got weak arm muscles you know so i feel like that won't be a problem for too long but that in my initial first feel for driving it that is something that i noticed uh i didn't show you these yesterday they're just standard there's no mirror in the driver's side one so it doesn't encourage girls to do their makeup while driving however there is one in the passenger side so if you want to do your makeup at some point you can do it when you're parked because you shouldn't be doing your makeup while driving anyway any woos i do also love these white leather armrests on the doors they're really cute which is another thing i didn't really mention yesterday another thing this is leather this is leather these middle sections here are fabric so i'm gonna get some fabric spray and treat them and hope that helps them get less stain but these i feel like over time are gonna be a little bit of an issue we will see uh also another thing the seats are super comfy um they're really nice and sporty looking they look they look amazing like i love the seats some of my favorite things about the car they look incredible um but they're also super comfortable i was so comfy driving all day yesterday and also here this is where your dipped headlights on it's got auto headlights anyway but that's your dipped headlight button i feel like that's everything i wanted to tell you now um now about the car uh a little compartment there i don't know that'll put anything in there uh yeah that's all i wanted to say really um other than that it's been really fantastic it's super zippy like i said before obviously i always have my jelly belly air freshener smells super cherry in here i love jelly bellies highly recommend them as well this was a nightmare i didn't know how to like get this obviously open is easy but get this off you have to use your key play with it before you leave because i made an idiot of myself at the at the petrol station yesterday also just in case anybody doesn't know because i didn't check before i got in my car but when you turn your car on i will show you quickly i'm actually supposed to be on my way to work right now but whatever and turn your car on you see the little petrol thing here whatever what direction that arrow is pointing that is where your petrol cap is do you ever get in the car and you're like where's my petrol cat that will show you where it's a very good tip it helped me yesterday i think that's everything i wanted to mention so yeah enjoy your car guys if you decide to go for this car enjoy it it's a very lovable car and i do think i do think it's great okay everyone so thank you for watching my car tour i really hope you enjoyed it and let me know in the comments if you're getting yourself a fiat 500 let's go

the boot this is a first impression review I've just picked up the keys to this car and I know nothing about it except for the little homework I did boot is decent it's a little bit smaller than average probably because of the hybrid underneath you have a little bit of storage under here but there's no spare tire the seats do fold flat by pressing the knob at the back of the seat however you do have a little bit of a lip over there let's go straight into the back seat this is my seating position I'll put the seat back up so that I can get in there and access is a little bit tight but you would expect it from such a car this is not my seating position as I can't access the lever to push a seat forward however this seat is in relatively my seating position and it's extremely tight here I'm very cramped I have no leg room and the headrest is actually digging into my back as I showed you earlier the seats do come down there's a lever here you push it in and they come down and you have access to the boot or you can load things through as far as cup holders is you have a couple of cup holders over here as well as the two in the front for the driving passenger these ones are also easy accessible for the drive-in passenger other than that there's not much more in the back here there's only two seats for adults you cannot fit three passengers three adult passengers on the back and it's really only suitable for young children you have a couple of speakers one here and one on the other side and that's really about it there is a nice viewing up the front especially with the sunroof it does feel a little bit Airy back here it's not like other vehicles where it's all dark and cramped so that's not too bad that would be a plus for this car all right coming into the Front Gotta tell you the seats are extremely supportive you've got nice cushions on the side um of your seat Plus for the back is very very supportive on the back which is uh very nice I gotta tell you compared to its competitors the seats are quite comfortable by the way guys if you haven't yet done so I'd really appreciate it if you can give this video a like I've started giving reviews on cars recently I'm not great but we will get there make sure to subscribe to my channel hit the Bell icon so that you get notified next time I upload a video of a first impression review no script no practice just get in the car and drive this will be the most Real review you'll ever see unlike other people either not check out the car before I don't prepare it I just get into it make sure to subscribe thank you now back in 2007 when this 500 came out the Cinco Cento it was based on the original cinquecento I actually bought one and I gotta tell you although it's very similar to that one but the materials do feel a little bit better than the car I had steering wheel is nice soft touch buttons being the Dolce Vita you do not get the climate control that is only on the Dolce Vita plus but you have a nice beautiful infotainment screen here infotainment system you have a manual volume button which is great on cars today because for some reason cars forget to put that in the material does feel a little bit scratchy and I do not like this Fake Plastic that they put on cars lately it makes it look cheap it looks nice it looks cute but it's freezing cold today it's only two degrees outside in London it's absolutely freezing and you can feel it but the um the plastic that's hard plastic on the doors you can feel that and it's horrible having said that a bit lower down this part here is a little bit squidgy fake leather feel one thing I like about the Fiat 500 which had on my car originally back in 2007 is a steering wheel button where when you press it it um it's this is the regular steering which is light but when you press it again this goes into City mode and it makes the steering wheel so light you can literally turn it with your little finger a very nice touch on the sphere 500 that's always been like this infotainment system is nice when you press on the buttons although it doesn't vibrate like the Audis do but it does make a little bit of a noise if you listen you'll hear it I hope this comes through on the video so you get confirmation that you have actually pressed a button this model being the Dolce Vita does come with Apple carplay and Android auto which the basic pop model doesn't this is the one liter 70 brake horsepower and price to start for this one at about six just under 16 and a half thousand pounds here in the UK the storage is not great there's a glove box which is relatively decent size it's quite deep so that's pretty good but the door bins are very small you feel very cramped down here at the sides there is not much room you can't even fit your hand down there but luckily they put the seating controls on the side of on the inside of the seat cup holders you get two over here and like I said before you get two in the back as well there are two USB ports so multiple people can charge the phones or put other devices in you also get a 12 volt socket this car does come with electric windows and to close it you have to hold it for a couple of seconds for it to that you can take your finger off and it closes automatically you have a sunroof here which does not open it does come with a sun shade which is nice um especially for a day like today and it's quite bright in London so it's a beautiful touch they say this car does about 60 miles per gallon I think that's a lot of crap uh you'll probably get realistically about 45 to 48 miles per gallon in this car uh you got sun visors a light and manual air conditioning I like this instrument cluster it's it's it's very simple very basic you got the the speedometer on the outside the rev counter on the inside and it does show you all the basic information you need you can control certain things from the steering wheel obviously you got the volume button which is over here and on this side you have the phone controls and if you press this one it controls the radio it switches between different stations on the left I'm not really sure what that does I'll assume the volume there we go I will take it for a short point of view test drive now just to see how it drives and report back as I go I have not driven this car at all I've literally just come out of that parking spot over there the steering is really really light I really like the steering I will do a separate video of a longer point of view test drive so make sure to click on this link over here to watch that video okay the clutch is nice it's a it's quite light it's not too bad a gear change is a little bit rough I like the gear change in the key is it's a little bit smoother than this one um yeah it's nice it feels very Nimble very very nimble suspensions make a little bit of noise you hear that and there's a lot of road noise coming from the tires even though I'm only going 20 miles an hour but that's quite normal in these small City cars I'm currently in fourth gear there is no power having said that I'm only going 20 miles an hour if I shift this down to Third there we go shift into second and it moves engine is a bit bit noisy a little bit excited but again that's expected from a small engine car like this one feels very comfortable on the road extremely comfortable without those bumps it's a nice smooth Easy Ride anyway I just wanted to return a nice a-road just to see what it's like at speed and the pickup is okay it's got a decent pickup for this size engine I'm actually quite impressed with that I do have a speed limit of only 50 miles per hour here so I cannot take it on highway speed having said that this should give us a good enough feel of how this would be on the highway and although I said earlier it's probably it would probably be a little bit out of its depth on the highway having driving it now for a few minutes I sort of changed my mind on that it feels very very settled I mean I'm in sixth going just under 50 miles an hour and it's slowly picking up obviously there's not enough power for me I'd like it to pick up a little bit more so I put it down into fifth uh fifth going out to what is it 45 miles an hour and it's picking up slowly it feels extremely settled at the speed and I'm sure if I took it 70 as is the speed limit in this country it would feel comfortable at that level too we got the Roses coming up on the right [Music] up into six I got to tell you it's lovely I've spent now half an hour in this car I I absolutely love it I think I prefer this over the Toyota Yaris even though the tot Iris does come with more options as standard um I love the cruise control that the tot Iris comes with the start stop the slowest the way it speeds up and slows down when the traffic speeds up and slows down with you but that's for highway driving but for City driving this is definitely better it's more comfortable it's Nimble the seats are much more supportive it's much more stylish I absolutely prefer this over the tot ARIS but it's nice the steering wheel feels really good I love the steering on this car I absolutely love the steering you turn it and the whole car shifts directions very Nimble very very nice very very nice I like this car when it came out in 2007 and I like it today as well today it's a freezing cold freezing cold day in London freezing it was -3 last night yeah so please feel free to give this video a like I'm gonna do a separate video as I said earlier on a longer test drive where I'm not going to say anything I'm just gonna sit in here drive I'll take on different roads feel free to watch that next but yeah this is a lovely little car absolutely lovely I like it I would approve of this car compared to the mini I prefer this the mini is cuter and the mini is more like a go-kart than this one but it's very choppy it's very expensive uh this one as I said earlier the pop stars I think from just under 15 000 pound and this Dolce Vita model is uh just under 16 and a half thousand you can upgrade to the Dolce Vita plus where you get electric climate control and other bits and pieces for another 1500 quid but personally I don't see the value of money for that not sure it's worth it to be honest yeah this is the model I would go for foreign yeah this is a beautiful car the Comic Con I would buy for my partner I'm not sure I'd buy for myself a little bit feminine for me but I would definitely uh buy this for my partner now the gear change is not great it's it's not smooth enough I I I I prefer even the citroens are smoother than this but then again it's an Italian car and Italians are not known for their gearboxes the gear changes anyway I hope you've enjoyed it please like subscribe videos uploaded weekly our first impression point of view test drives and reviews absolutely love it watch what's the next video [Music]

500 dolce vita the fiat chincochento is as italian as nona's homemade pasta and it is to the turin-based car company something of historical significance it was built in 1957 and it was pretty much the people's car of italy it was built small and it was built cheap the fact that it had a fabric roof was simply down to cost not down to the lifestyle that comes with it not like it is today where you've got a soft top and a hard top option so we decided to go to italy to review it okay not really but as close as we're gonna get to italy in sunny south africa ladies and gentlemen welcome to monte cassino monte casino was built just over two decades ago and the engineers modeled it on a proper italian village they flew to italy traveled around took many pictures studied the architecture and then came back to replicate that right here in the heart of joburg my goal for the day is to explore little italy and joburg and find me a great gelato and a great cup of coffee haha we're actually inside monte cassino you thought we were going to drive around it didn't you no we're not we're driving inside the village and as soon as we arrive hello we have blue skies above us and that calls for one thing i'm gonna drop the top [Music] this one there we go all right now let's go see what monty has to offer the fiat 500 was and is a phenomenon for decades fiertis sold over six million of these and counting so the fiat 500 here in sa comes in four flavors if you like they start with a cult that's really the base level it's got steel wheels and daytime running lights and quite a bit of spec but then they up the ante and they get to the connect which as the name suggests will up the ante in terms of infotainment it has um apple carplay and android auto and all those beautiful things and then they go up to this the dolce vita which is my personal favorite and what i love about it is just the most aesthetically let's call it resolved it's got a few more badges got a bit more panache as it were you can get it in a two-tone color as well and that always is a hit you can get it in a cab or a hard top yeah for me it's just the one to have of course you can get into the sport as well the sport just uh ups the ante again in terms of just making a bit more uh sporty i suppose this for me is the one it's the one that most people will buy i reckon and for this cabrio version at 324 000 bucks or a smidge over i think it's quite a lot of car the fiat 500 is one of those cars that really sets itself apart in a sea of sameness in the same way that it stood out from the crowd all those years ago it still does so today and in the process has lost none of its cool factor while staying on a really competitive price point jeez are you serious right now ah felicia sorry boss sorry sorry how are you doing i am sorry i'm sorry man i'm sorry i know i know i'm sorry man it's just the cause the car is so fast next time next time oh thanks man next time i think no i know i know i know your place no no i understand i understand no sorry boss sorry ah just uh dodged the bullet there so in the heat of that little moment i found me some gelato as far as cars go the fiat 500 is small that's what it's always been about the first one was just 2.7 meters in length it was tiny and it had a tiny engine too a 479 cc air cooled job so fast forward 60 years and look at it it's still small okay sure they've added 80 centimeters and okay sure it now has a turbocharged 875 cc motor but that's still tiny it's motorbike stuff but that's the whole point small is cool when you're talking about the fiat 500 and it's light too weighs less than a ton so here's what's going to happen you're going to get decent performance from a tiny engine and at 20 bucks a liter for petrol this thing turns in four liters per hundred at the pumps and that is not bad this gelato is not bad either when it comes to safety the fiat 500 is very well taken care of with seven airbags yes abs electronic stability control hill descent control as well as cruise control and speed limiter on the downside this mta transmission takes some getting used to you almost need to understand it as a manual that's been convinced to change gears itself i don't know it still changes as if you were depressing the clutch and releasing it again but it's just not perfect all right so i'm going to the piazza because uh i think i need me a cup of coffee that's looking promising squeeze through these doors [Music] see what i mean small compact easy and now we're into some real sunlight it's typical italian yeah i can smell food and smell coffee i think this is the way to go that's not gonna work is it oh man as small as this car is uh i can't find my way down there um well we're gonna have to make another plan [Music] all right so monty's given us another access point to the piazza it's a bit of a tight squeeze but i think we'll be able to break out into the outside all right and we're through into not entirely blue skies but a cloudy johannesburg sky we've taken a slightly more circuitous route but uh do you know what it's been quite pretty and quite interesting and we're making our way to the piazza it's like that town square that every italian village has that's where everything happens all these buzz there's great vibe great music probably great food it's a place where everyone goes and hangs out and i'm quite happy with the longer route too because it gives me a chance to just enjoy this real open-air motoring because that's what fiat 500 in the cab is about right live in la dolce vita living that dolce vita life it's a lifestyle and that's why i like the fact that we're now here we got the roof open we can see the sky and enjoy the breeze through our hair that's what it's about it's this kind of it's kind of sophisticated but accessible and here we are welcome to the monte cassino piazza [Music] it feels authentic to be pulling in with a fiat 500 into an italian square doesn't that feel just right right at home [Music] the feared 500 is the modern interpretation of an italian icon and driving through monte cassino today has helped me understand more about the romance and the lifestyle that comes with cinco chiento now let me go find that coffee you

my channel or if you are new here then welcome today's video is going to be a super exciting video for me because it is one that i love watching myself i find them really really interesting so i thought i would do my own and i just i love filming these types of videos for you guys so yeah this is going to be a fiat 500 car tour i got a fiat 500 i've had this for just under a month i would say and i absolutely love it so much so i will just show you what i can kind of see when i'm in my car so obviously i'm sat in the driver's seat here i do have my slippers on with socks don't mind me but yeah this is kind of what i see when i'm sat in the driver's seat this is the steering wheel and honestly the interior is one of the big things i absolutely love about the fear just show you the little compartments that it has as well so down here is just this little compartment here this is just where i keep masks that i wear the most very 20 20 but there we are they're just really easy to reach so that i don't forget them and yeah they're just in there and then obviously you've just got the little vent um for the heating etc there's also this little compartment i know lots of people have got like a pull out bit but mine's just this little neck and then this is the door handle here you can see me in this section compress it in to lock the car like that and then flick it like that and then here is just a little compartment sometimes i have things in there but most time i just keep it empty here is just for my mirrors out there this just controls them to move them around and then i've got another side compartment here i've literally just got a lipstick on my phone case because when i film i take my phone case off but that is just the little compartment in there so that is that section there just like the driver's side section it's pretty much the same on the passenger seat has the very same little compartment here and then the same big compartment along here this does run all the way like to the back there which i really really love and again i have nothing in there other than an umbrella in case it rains but i like to push that back like that i do just have these fiat 500 car mats these actually were from another fiat at the dealership we kind of got them thrown in dub was like is there anything else you can give us and they're like i suppose we can give you those so i really like them they just cream along the side there and then they say 500 here but what i really love is a bit here pops in and out so it has a little connector bit there and you can pop it in just like that that's really handy especially with the driver's side because the mat doesn't slip around a lot i know in my old car the mac used to move around so much and push under the pedals too much and it used to get on my nerves so the fact that these pop in and stay there is so helpful then i just have this little compartment in here i don't have too much in here i just have a spray this one just smells like vanilla it's the soda by elixir i just have this cute little bag with some girly essentials in it so i've got some tampons a scrunchie a hairband perfume lip gloss and some makeup wipes just like a little emergency car pack then i just have some spare masks i have a fork for when i eat my lunch at work and then also just this smelly thing so it smells all nice and fresh in there then i just have this little thing to keep my phone in i found it really really hard to find one for fiat and because the vents are really really small in this car so yeah i did have another one in my old car but me and my dad swapped i can't remember where he got this from but i know you can get lots on amazon but it basically just closes around your phone like that obviously my phone's not that small and then at the back there's a little button and you just press it and it opens up just like that but yeah when it's here it kind of gets in the way too much so i like to just pop it here so that i can still see it if i'm using maps or something but it's not right in my way then down here i just have this little tub that is filled with sweets this has got lots of weather's originals in it at the minute which i love and this little cream bow just goes with the interior of the car then i've got this i absolutely love to spray i spray this every single day it's the victoria secret fresh snowfall this smells so so good and i just love to keep this in my car spray this before i go anywhere and i have these two other compartments here these are just like cup holders i did just clean this but obviously not very well and then this little section here and i just keep in a hand sanitizer so i've got the bath and body works warm vanilla there obviously again very 20 um and then this which is not my best friend to be honest just got an aux little section and then this bit that you can plug in like a iphone charger this is very scratched up um this was not me this was a previous owner that scratched this up so much but the aux works most of the time but this really really really plays up even when i try different leads so very very annoying but yeah and then also down the side here obviously i have these plugged in i've just bound them up like this but usually i have them out and then there's just like a little section in there but i tend to keep them like so also in a fiat 500 you may have noticed that the gear stick is up here usually it's obviously like down here but i actually really find it comfortable having my gear stick like this at first it was really hard to get used to when i went to change gears i'd like go down here but now i'm so so used to it and it's so comfortable especially being shorter it's nice not having to reach right down for the gear stick and having it here instead so i really really actually love that about this and i think even this is like so aesthetically pleasing it just looks so good do you know what i mean so yeah also can we appreciate my key how cute is this so this is just a key cover that i got off of ebay you can get them on like etsy ebay amazon i believe and like other websites but yeah i've just got this gorgeous key cover and then literally my house case is the car key and it also flips out just like that and things i brought for the car i got this little gray aux lead this was from amazon obviously it is longer and then i've just got my normal charger and then on the back of my chairs i just have these hooks i've got one on the back of the passenger side and one on the back of the driver's side which i just have my bag hanging off of so i just jump in my car and i pop my bag on just like that and they literally just look like this i got these off of amazon and they're really really handy they literally just slot over i'm trying to do this with my left hand they just slot over the tail like that really handy for bags coats anything like that and then i do in the back have this little cleaning section here so i like to keep this in my car because i like to clean my car quite often so i've got this little gray plastic compartment here and this was just from b m i think it was literally only like four pounds and then i've got my ice scraper which i've been using a hell of a lot recently so i just keep this in with these because yeah i reach for it a lot i've got some antibacterial like hand wipes and then some antibacterial cleaning wipes i've got this febreze fabric refresher i like to spray this on all like the upholstery so all of the chairs and the carpets and things to keep it smelling nice and fresh in here i've also got this unstoppable spray i'll say if i've eaten my lunch i might just clean my car and then spray this so it still smells nice and fresh in here as well and then also i have this disinfectant so this is the fabulosa fairy dust and this smells so so so nice i literally just use that to clean like all these sections here like my serum oil everything um i just use to clean disinfect and make it smell really nice and then i've just got a cloth here and a little duster thing there i love cleaning my car on my lunch breaks i don't know why i just i really enjoy it so that is when i tend to do that just give it a little freshen up every few days so i'll show you like this front section here um like the radio and stuff quickly so if i just quickly turn the car on obviously i'm not going to be driving away so don't drive and go on your phone guys turn the radio down and the heating off okay so here i've got this is city steering and it basically just gives you more leeway on the steering but i like to have that off when you turn it on it just says city up there as you can see but like i said i like it off then i've just got my hazard lights and then this here is my fog lights here is where i turn my headlights on so i just literally twist this and this little section comes up here and then obviously if it's foggy i can turn my fog lights on too which just comes up here and for full beam i literally just push this forward and then pull it back to turn it off and then this is also in my indicators here then here is just like all the heating section so i've literally just got obviously the temperature um and then you can turn them up and down i don't really know what it means but i found that when i have it on this it goes on the screens much more and then this one circulates around the car switch between this and this one a lot don't actually know what this one is to be honest please let me know if you do know it's probably very easy i'm probably just being very dumb this is start stop which i have this off and that shows up here i don't know why it shows when it's off rather than when it's on but hey hi so yeah that is there this is the back screen and then i don't know what this is either um not sure um but yeah then obviously i've got my glue stick and then this is another odd thing about fiat instead of the windows being over here they are over here again that is something that i found hard to get used to but it's so much easier now having everything here and then please excuse that this has dust on it because i've dusted it so many times and these bits just won't come off but yeah this is something that i was really really happy that this car had because lots of fiats don't have this radio here they just have a cd player but yeah this has the radio um and then when i click this it will like connect to either aux or my phone depending on i've used um but yeah and then this i don't really know what abc means this is a volume here and you can also turn the radio on and off this is like all radio stations this will silence the music and this will change what song it is i'm not sure what this one does i've not tried it out yet um this just gives you information you can keep this on and it will kind of say what radio station you're on and stuff um and you can like tune in here as well this you can press and it comes up a list of radio stations i'm pretty sure you can tune more in here but i tend to i don't really listen to the radio much but if i do i listen to kiss radio one or sometimes heart that is on there don't know where it's gone but yeah and then here um this is just kind of all different bits and pieces that i don't really touch i just leave it and then this is a menu yeah that is the radio there and then this here is when the car is on obviously so i have the date the temperature how many miles the car's done um and then the car temperature i believe and then my fuel here and fun fact guys did you guys know all cars like there's so many people that haven't heard this all cars you see that little arrow next to the pump that means that is the side that your fuel cap is on so i know mine is the driver's side so i go and get my fuel on that side but yeah i don't know if everyone knows that but i didn't know it until i think i saw it on tick-tock this is because i don't have my seat belt on right now because i'm not moving like i said oh oops and this is because i have my handbrake on this is probably very common knowledge to lots of you guys but anyone that may be getting a fiat for their first car this is what it all means this here is just kind of how i change i believe this is my lights my headlight height um and then these are you can change all of this information through these as well which i did have to do because the time was wrong then on my steering wheel i've got this which is the same as this button here this just mutes the music and i've got up and down volume and then here i can change the song and so i can go forward or back and then this is to search for like another radio station if i want to obviously when i press this it beeps the horn shall i do it shall i do it is there anyone around well i'm sorry gonna be like why did you be here is just my window wipers and you can adjust lots here this here if i twist it it turns the back wind wiper on and i literally just pull this down to turn my wipers on and the more i pull it down the quicker they go so you can pull them fast if i push this forward it cleans the back screen and if i pull it turn off if i pull it it will clean the front screen so like that i do have this here as well i don't know where this is from but it smells really really nice like here lots of people won't care about this if you are getting a new fear and you're confused um i was very confused at first but you just pop it like that to turn it on and off when i first got this car i was really excited to try and find all like the hidden compartments but this car doesn't have it like under that seat there's no compartment googled it and it actually said that i think after a second year they don't have the compartments which was like she would have thought that the slightly newer fiats would have had them but mine's 2017 and i think that was the cut off where they don't have them i'm not sure it said it on google let me know if you guys do have 2017 fiat or newer and you have the compartments but i don't so maybe it's because this is the pop model who knows so yeah i really hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did don't forget to give it a big thumbs up and subscribe and i'll see you in my next video bye guys

office obviously it was you know it's got its quirk it's unique it's small and nippy and a little bit odd um but i always wondered you know what is the kind of person who buys it who's the customer and obviously i mean it's so successful three million have been sold of that gin or this generation um but terence and i used to discuss it a lot so i used to say i mean i hate saying this and it's a terrible sexist shocking thing but we learn from our mistakes to say it's quite a sort of feminine sort of girl car okay i would never say that about a car now never terrance used to disagree with me maybe he was a lot more ahead of his time than i was but anyways i just say if a guy comes and fetches you in a car what does it say about his taste in cars in this car um tends to say what means he knows exactly what he's talking about and he's great and he's like i don't know i don't know anyways we never managed to come to an agreement on it because also he loves minnie and i'm not a huge mini fan as you all know um mainly because i'm all about practical and all about expense and whatever which then maybe makes this one a bit more suitable to me but just not in terms of space anyways my phone's just dropped there this has had an update okay so it's got new trim levels you've got cult connect sport which am i i'm in and dolce vita and the cabriolet is obs uh and it's got some new colors it's got um other things like the front has been a little bit redesigned i mean it looks pretty much the same but it's got this new seven-inch touchscreen on the hi on the up high respect models um a bit outdated for me not my favorite uh thing the sunroof will hey does sunroof and this one has mesh covering it so i can't even like close it close it so it bothers me because i can't see the entertainment system properly if it's open i also just feel hot all the time the sun's on my head a lot but it does make it all feel a bit more spacey and airy in here which is the point i guess visibility is fantastic in this car um so it's got all the safety features seven airbags uh he'll start assist stability electricity control you know what i'm talking about um still got the little 0.9 liter two-cylinder engine you get 62.5 kilowatts okay that point five is important when it's this little you've got to you know take every little bit you get and 145 newton meters of torque um so it's it's certainly nippy that's what it is it's a city car hey vegas a fellow fiat 500 i mean you just see them everywhere i think my problem with it is the noise of the engine some people love it they find that's part of the charm i'm like shouting at you over it so that's never a good thing for me um i get it i get the nostalgia of it but for me no i think things have moved no now just picture yourself a glass of red wine some pasta on the go oh okay maybe driving this then having the red wine and then you know a little bit of a little bit on this oh [Music] the claim fuel consumption is four liters per 100k which is plus all but i i'm sitting at about 6.4 liters um when i got the car it was sitting at about 5.7 so you can get it down depending on how you drive this is a cruise control so that's pretty cool i mean look it's been sort of over 14 years it needed a bit of an update you know which is probably what a lot of people might say about me but no or we can just put it down to iconic you know me and the car look at me just comparing myself to feared 500s iconicism so the entry-level celt starts at just under 220 000 rand that's like bang entry level um this sport sits at just under 270 000 which i don't think it's actually that bad i think it's pretty good value for money for you getting if you go to the cabriolets you're going past the 300 000 mark but again you're paying for little cabriolet it's so much more quirky more fun so i thought i kind of get it that is shining on my phone i can see it now i look like i'm just waiting for the camera driving along the coast pretending i'm in italy space wise it's not obviously particularly practical which it's not supposed to be it's not a family car but it does have isofix so i have put luca in the back uh with the baby seat and fine he can fit getting him in up not a vibe but here we are to two door but the the passenger well there's no passenger here if you've got that seat and it's but squishy you know knees to chased and all um and the boots are 188 liters which is not fantastic obviously but i did manage to get three bottles of wine in there yesterday bottles cases man three cases of wine in there um with a couple of storage things that i bought from mumbos oh i love my little bumbo's shop if you're not south african it's like a big plastic shop everything like a whole bunch of i mean i know plastic people are gonna get plastic haters gonna hate that but like you know like storage bins and things like that and plates and everything basically oh i can spend my whole amount of money that i get there anyways this is a car that i think for the singles you know like a a person who doesn't have kids or does need a lot of space you know maybe old terry pants you know he loves it he could he could live in in fact i don't think he could now i think he would change his mind especially if he has to drive to joburg and back uh in it with roscoe you know and a partner you're what are you gonna do then there's nay space for you nothing so yeah you have to be quite quite single or an empty nester and you really don't need space just need a a towel nip around then it is perfect please you you you fun okay

I&#39;m seriously thinking about getting one in the future.', 'Fiat 500 Mini Hybrid<br>For us, the 1922, Fiat 500 Mini Hybrid from Sixt Auto Rental was a perfect match for our 19-day journey on the narrow two-lane roads through France‚Äôs forest and medieval villages.<br>On that journey in May 2023, we drove as close to the Loire River as possible, from its mouth at Saint-Nazaire to its source at Mont Gerbier de Jonc; then on to Thueyts in the Ardeche; then to Lyon where we returned the Fiat to Sixt Auto Rental.<br>I do have one reservation, and that was: The hundreds of tuning circles in France were a busy exercise with the 6-speed manual gearbox.<br><br>In closing: If I were to own my own car here in Seattle, I would want a Fiat 500 Mini Hybrid. Leif in Seattle', 'I drove a Fiat 500 &quot;hybrid&quot; this weekend and I don&#39;t know how they&#39;re allowed to get away with it legally. The petrol engine was constantly running and if there is any electric motor at all, it&#39;s a delivering an extremely minimal contribution to the vehicle performance &amp; efficiency.', 'nice comprehensive review......nice work....', 'I&#39;m the girl with the pink one at the gym üòÇ love my fiat ü©∑', '‚ÄòOverly familiar with the offerings of Colonel Sanders‚Äô üòÇüòÇüòÇ', 'I love my 500 sport cabrio hybrid. It is really beautyful', 'What worries me about these new hybrid engines is the nagging feeling that buyers are being used as part of an experiment to placate the car hating eco fanatics. How long will this hybrid battery last and how much will it cost to replace? I&#39;ve read of batteries failing in more expensive cars and costing almost as much as the car was worth to replace. It seems a pointless change as the 500 was hardly a gas guzzler before and a simpler proven 1.2 engine made for a more confidence inspiring purchase, much less to go wrong and probably cheaper to service and local garages could do maintenance.', 'I&#39;m one of the very few blokes to own a 500. Mine&#39;s a 2009 1.2 Pop. I much prefer this earlier styling with the &#39;solid&#39; rear lights and generally less fussy detailing.  The simple, body-coloured dash is lovely. No screens and buttons everywhere, just classic chic. I can&#39;t see much benefit at all in the new 1.0 engine and additional technology.  Most girly owners won&#39;t even be aware of it. The 1.2 is a tried and tested bullet-proof unit that&#39;s easy to service and gives me 45-60mpg.  I tried to get the cherished registration G1 RLY but it is already assigned. The best accessory is a blanket called &#39;Gurli&#39; available from IKEA!', 'Yes!', 'Still too much emphasis on 0-60 and top speed figures when in reality its not important in a car such as this. If someone wants a fast car, they simply buy a fast car but we have speed limits and other traffic on the roads. Its as though a car with relatively low power is seen as dull or boring, but in actual fact it says far more about the attitude of todays drivers. Any car is capable of keeping up with traffic no matter how small the BHP. Impatience and lack of observation causes most of the problems on the roads today. The obsession with speed is immature.', 'All that talk about features - what about how the thing is on the road? I didn&#39;t watch till the end, only about 3/4 of the way through.', 'Our Star version returns more than 60 mpg and charges when you take your foot off the accelerator and are slowing in gear, you can feel the extra retardation. I also have the relevant space saver spare wheel fitting in with no problem. The engine is generally quiet although you need to use the gears for acceleration and we are very happy with it in every other way.', 'Is it using Peugeot 3 cylinder engine?', 'Anyone know how noisy the revs are when you pull away at lights etc please? Great review and I like it but we can‚Äôt test drive right now and slightly worried in case it‚Äôs too noisy', 'I don&#39;t agree with the comments about rear visibility - it isn&#39;t a problem, and the there IS a small footrest on the right hand side of the centre console.  Seems like the reviewer was a little picky for what is still the most stylish car in the sector. The 500 has far more character than the alternative German, Japanese or Eastern competitors and that is what customers buy into.  <br>Gear change on the 6 speed is much slicker than the reviewer suggests and reverse is EASY to select - you have to lift the collar.<br>There IS a spacesaver spare wheel option which replaces the tyre goop/inflator tray that you very briefly show in the video.  Since the Hybrid came out, the Lounge trim no longer has the fixed glass sunroof and the Star trim upwards have the pictured instrument binnacle. <br>Slightly sloppy research for such a lengthy review.  But you are correct about the style!', 'I&#39;d never buy a fiat just junk!', 'The Honda PCX hybrid scooter has a bigger battery than this car.', 'Don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve got this version in Australia?

little 500 city car continues on in mild hybrid guys otherwise this stylish package hasn't been fundamentally changed but then loyal buyers didn't really want it to be these people will like the smart look the various media options and the very individual feel you can tell that fiat knows its market [Music] if ever a car has built its brand it's this one fiat 500 we've had three generations of this car over the years and all have been pivotal to fiat's existence as a car maker this is the cinquecento though that you'll probably most easily recognize the second generation model which after 13 years on sale received its most significant update in early 2020 with the introduction of mild hybrid power it's all part of a move towards electrification which has also brought us a more significant milestone in fiat 500 history introduction of a completely new third generation full electric battery powered version but that new 500 takes the brand into a completely new and much pricier market segment that for the time being anyway abandons most of the folk that for the last half a century have made the 500 the enduring success story it is which is why to serve those people this second generation model not only continues alongside its newest stablemate but has also been rejuvenated with the completely new mild hybrid powertrain that we're going to test today it's a little strange thinking of this 21st century mark ii model as the basic 500 series alternative back in 2007 it seemed such a technological marvel in comparison to the cinquino original the so-called bambino model which back in 1957 was conceived as an alternative to a scooter this second generation 500 styled by frank stevenson and derived from a trepuno concept car first shown in 2004 was like the volkswagen beetle and the mini a 50s people's model reinvented as a new millennial fashion trinket to great effect fiat of course tweaked with this second generation design over the years in 2011 we got a clever twin air two-cylinder engine that sounded great but never got near its quoted fuel stats there was a 1.3 litre diesel variant which was introduced deleted and then reintroduced again and in 2015 there was a facelift with over 1900 changes most of which you couldn't see feel or touch throughout buyers were offered the option of either this fixed top three-door hatch model or a 500c open-topped variant of the same body shape that stopped short of being a full convertible but which offered a fabric folding section in its roof both body styles were also offered with 1.4 litre turbo petrol power by the abarth brand and that continues here but in ever decreasing numbers otherwise the only a combustion-powered engine you can now get in either this three-door hatch or the 500c is now this one the previous rather ancient old mainstream 1.2 liter four-cylinder unit replaced by this one liter three-cylinder motor paired with a 12-volt belt integrated starter generator and a separate 11 amp hour lithium battery all of which develops a modest 70 horsepower what's an offer here isn't any sort of full hybrid the car can never drive solely under battery power but fiat says this power plant's clever 12 volt electrified architecture can reduce co2 emissions by up to 30 which sounds promising will it all be enough though to significantly prolong the lifespan of one of this century's most definitive small cars let's find out [Music] get the look and feel of a car like this right and you could argue that it hardly matters how it drives that's certainly what fiat has done here for most potential owners how this 500 model feels on the online configurator is more important than how it feels on the road so it's no surprise for us to learn then that in this mark ii model's first 13 years of life over 80 percent of customers happily ignored all the various quite sophisticated engines that the italian brand was offering at various times with this car they stuck instead with the entry-level 1.2 litre four-cylinder petrol power plant which has been placed here in favor of a three-cylinder one liter mild hybrid unit now we've seen this firefly one liter engine with its two valves per cylinder layout before and a couple of fca group small suvs the fiat 500x and the jeep renegade in the form used in this 500 uh it's a bit different though it lacks a turbo charger but it gains a 12 volt belt starter generator known as a bsg along with an 11 amp hour lithium ion battery uh those are the major components of the mild hybrid system that the badging of this car now loudly trumpets in many ways that's a bit misleading uh there's nothing remotely prius like about this car i mean you can't drive it solely on its battery uh you certainly can't plug it in and there's no clever transmission like say the clutchless dog box auto of the renault cleo hybrid in fact if you came to this car as many will freshman version of this sphere with the old 1.2 liter four-cylinder engine which by the way continues with automatic dual logic variants of this model uh you'll probably hardly notice any differences at all even the 70 horsepower output of the new power plant is virtually the same as its predecessor was as are the performance stats rest to 62 in a leisurely 13.8 seconds on route to an academic maximum of 104 miles an hour there's not much more pulling power either just 92 newton meters of it which means you'll often have to thrash the car along a bit to make meaningful progress although the rumbly raw that you get when you do that is actually quite characterful still be all that as it may uh what's happening beneath the bonnet as you drive is all very different as the instrument displays new hybrid readouts seem to suggest as is the case with all mild hybrid units like for example the one that ford now uses in the fiesta the belt starter generator harvests energy during braking and deceleration and then stores it in the system's little integrated battery so it can be used in one of two ways either to aid acceleration or to power the cars auxiliaries as the engine stops start system activates when you're waiting at the lights or in a traffic queue uh there'll never be enough charge generated to power the car without the aid of its combustion engine and even if there was uh the little battery wouldn't be big enough to store it what this is then is less a hybrid power plant and more an embellishment to combustion engineering which boosts efficiency and that's by up to 30 in terms of co2 emissions according to fiat having crunched the stats since the last time we tested the previous version of this car back in 2015 we're struggling to see that actually and we've certainly found it difficult to discern much of the promise benefits and enhanced acceleration but then we've also found that with all the recent mild hybrid models we've tested there's a reason why full hybrid tech such as you'll find on say a toyota yaris hybrid or on that clear hybrid model we just mentioned costs a lot more now assuming you can't stretch the full electric new 500 model uh the only other powertrain option in this fiat which isn't our focus here is the 1.4 litre tj turbo petrol power plant which serves in the various hot hatch abarth derivatives offering 145 165 or even 180 brake horsepower that the italian engineers have managed to make these are bath variants brilliant fun to chuck around it's quite an achievement given that as a design the 500 is engineered around a fairly crude set of underpinnings uh the chassis originates from a mark ii panda launched way back in 2003 and it comes with suspension that allows low speed bumps to be felt and heard rather too often plus the steering of the mainstream models offers little feedback when you're pressing on across twist your roots and through those turns the softer setup of this fit means you can get quite a lot more body roll than you would in rivals like the mini hatch but of course this 500 is far more in its comfort zone around town where you'll be pleased to find that fiat has retained the city button on the fascia that lightens steering feel at parking speeds for urban use we still find the manual gearbox rather bulky although it does at least now have six rather than five speeds and it's a bit awkward to try to get into reverse too plus the slightly restricted rearward vision when you're trying to park makes rear parking sensors which usually cost extra something of a must still as we suggested at the beginning none of that really tends to matter to most potential buyers who can't look beyond the cute shape and the way that they're going to personalize the paintwork so it looks different when it's parked alongside the others at the gym they'll forgive this car much for its trendy demeanor it's cheeky engine note and it's turn on a sixpence maneuverability there's a super tight 9.3 meter turning circle plus it helps enormously that the high driving position and the big windows make this car easy to place on the road when you're drinking through town center traffic it's urban friendly through and through you see [Music] almost anyone knows what this car is and as far as we can tell almost every owner of one is female offhand in fact we can't think of a more gender specific model in the entire history of the motor car now if you do happen to be male and want one and you're uncomfortable with that then you could always dress it up as if it was a sporty abarth variant dressing a 500 up is of course key to the appeal of owning one this car virtually invented the concept of modern automotive personalization in terms of a starting point though not much is different here no visual changes have been part of the evolution into this mild hybrid model so the dinky looks remain as they have been since the facelift back in 2015 when frank stephenson's original design got a light wash and brush up in an age where little hatches often tend to have become rather less little this one remains appealingly small still measuring it just 3.5 meters long 1.6 meters wide and 1.5 meters high which means it can fit into spaces even a mini hatch would have to avoid and of course it's just as cute as ever with the same lovable short curvy dimensions and this distinct crease flowing above the door handles from the front wing to the rear light cluster wheel sizes vary between 14 and 16 inches in size we've got the 16 inch rims here and now if you choose the 500c variant rather than the fixed top model that we're testing today you get what amounts to a full length canvas sunroof which electrically retracts into a concertina bundle just above the boot [Applause] if your experience of this card dates to a much older version of this model it's here at the front that you'll notice most of the changes made as part of the 2015 facelift perhaps most notably the lipstick kissing theme of the led daytime running lights which graphically reproduce these zeros of the 500 name and frame lower corner lamps that take care of the dipped beam headlights and the turn signal duties the main round headlamps just above feature clever polyelliptical modules for improved nighttime vision the bonnet retains its distinctive traditional clamshell form and the trapezoidal nose gets pronounced ribbing the cooling is done by this lower intake with either end of this three-dimensional grille flanked by these little jewel-like fog lights and at the back well other changes made back in 2015 which a customer used to an older version of this design might notice include these so-called empty light clusters uh they're comprised of ring-shaped structures with body-colored centers incorporating this feature forced the relocation of the rear fog light and the reversing light lowered down into the edges of the bumper underneath as before this car is based on the aging underpinnings of a previous model fiat panda but potential owners rarely know this and they really care if they do know as mentioned earlier every 500 model invites a high degree of personalization via a myriad of color and trim permutation options but whatever you choose is sure to dovetail deliciously with the very well judged blend of retro chic and clean contemporary design in the cabin here inside delicious details are everywhere the coloured fascia panels feature iconic 500 badging and they're colour matched against the bodywork nothing's changed as part of the evolution into mild hybrid power unless you count the increased use of recycled plastic to create these restart seats here the upholstery has been fashioned from what's called sequel yarn that's derived from recycled plastic 10 of which originates from the sea and 90 of it from the land to create this special material plastic rubbish is reduced to flakes of polyethylene terephthalate which are then spun into the yarn from which this fabric is made alongside other natural recycled or recovered fibers now that all fits rather with the eco hybrid theme it can still feel pretty up to date in here if you spend a bit extra and get this optional seven 7-inch tft instrument cluster and this uconnect center dash touchscreen few 500 owners bother with paying more for the instrument binnacle monitor although takeout for this feature might be a bit higher now because it's able to graphically show the hybrid system charging up its little battery as you drive it other selectable screen options that you can view through this chunky three-spoke wheel include readouts on trip computer data tyre pressures and range plus this display can also brief you on battery energy generation and show a power charge meter designated by little green and blue strips as the wheels turn the screen is flanked at its outer rim by readouts for revs on the left and what fit calls an eco index on the right the latter there to score the efficiency of your driving this 7-inch central uconnect live infotainment display hd screen and mounted right in your line of sight high on the dashboard also incorporates quite a lot although you only get that as standard as an alternative to the base uconnect radio if you can avoid entry level trim 3d navigation can be added in and it's standard at the top of the range all the uconnect live center screen packages include voice recognition apple carplay and android auto smartphone mirroring a dab audio system bluetooth hands-free calling music streaming and an sms reader that will read out your text messages to you via the uconnect live setup you can keep up with your friends on facebook and twitter you can keep up with the news via reuters you can select from more than 35 million music tracks via deezer and access over 100 000 global radio stations via tuning not much has changed in terms of getting comfortable it's still disappointing to find that there's no reach adjustment for the steering wheel and the seat height adjustment is still lacking on the entry level model still the seat itself has been made slightly more comfortable since fiat ergonomically reshaped it as part of this car's facelift updates plus the upgraded materials that are now used have rather smartened the interior ambience up a bit although cheaper plastics are still evident the further down you look back in 2007 these didn't really detract from what then seemed quite an upmarket feeling fascia these days of course standards have changed a bit even the cheapest super minis now feature plastics as good or better than those in evidence here still at least the car seems to have been well screwed together in its polish factory in-cabin stowage remains acceptable provided your standard of measurement is for a city car and not a larger fiesta size super mini now you won't be short of cup holders definitely you'll find two of them both ahead of and behind the handbrake ahead of the front cup holders is a cubby with a nearby 12 volt socket behind these front cup holders is a usb port the door bins are rather slim but the glove box that's reasonably sized and you also get a cubby by the driver's right knee and ticket clips on these sun visors here as for all round vision while predictably a 500 isn't as easy to see out of as its boxier fiat panda showroom stablemate especially when you're looking over your shoulder and trying to park that might be an issue because rear parking sensors cost extra on most models at junctions uh you'll find that the front a pillars are on the chunky side too other issues uh well not too many the seat itself is set rather high that's something you particularly notice if you have a car with this one's fixed sunroof that's a feature which most parents do now include but it's one that rather eats into the head room uh the infotainment screen attracts reflections and the narrow pedal box annoyingly lacks a foot rest and it might be a bit tight for those who are over familiar with the offerings of colonel sanders uh it's impossible to be irritated with this car for long though it's just so engagingly designed the pull ball style gear stick mounted high on the dash here the art deco silver door handles the earlobe style vents around the infotainment screen the bakelite style fitting surrounding the ventilation controls all of it's fun and trendy and reasonably ergonomic time to move into the rear seat well given that the external dimensions of this car are so short you won't be expecting to find much room here and there isn't a taller folk will find their heads brushing the roof mind you that's always been the case in the fiat 500 the ceiling of the 1957 original was swept back too and that was in order to differentiate that from the fiat 600 model of the day now here the differentiation point is with fiat's panda city car which by the way can be had with exactly the same mild hybrid engineering that features here and is more spacious and practical than a 500 in just about every way there is a premium to pay for this 500 models cute stylishness in more ways than one larger adults will need to make full use of the elbow cutouts indented into the side panels most though will find the space provided just about sufficient for two people on short to medium journeys and it'll probably be fine for kids who of course are provided with the isofix child seat fastenings you'll only be able to fit in two of them though now we were a bit dismayed to find that fear charges extra for these rear head restraints with entry level trim i mean without these there would be neck safety implications for adults traveling back here younger folk will appreciate the fact that these uh side windows they're quite big but old offspring they're going to be irritated with the lack of any sort of usb port back here otherwise there's some reasonable practicality back here and that's thanks to a pocket on the left hand seat back and easy access to the central cup holders behind the gear stick out back the boot has a high lip and a narrow opening and it remains one of the more compact offerings in the segment uh once you get your stuff in past this tiny parcel shelf though the 185 liter space provided is no smaller than an ordinary mainstream city car like toyota's igo would give you now if you're looking at stylized city car alternatives uh well yes you would get about 10 percent more room in a mini hatch but the capacity provided here is the same as you get in a smart 4 4. this recessed area to the right here means that there's slightly more width for wider items than you initially think but bag hooks and the traditional floor tying eyes they've both been forgotten and there's no space for a spare wheel of any kind beneath this flimsy floor cover you would probably want to consider the optional luggage compartment organizer to make the most of this space if you do need to carry more then you can push forward the rear bench and that split folds in all but the entry trim level variant this frees up 550 liters in this standard hatch model the folded seats though don't get anywhere near to folding flush with the base of the cargo area and there's no adjustable height boot floor option to even things out a bit bear in mind if you opt for the 500c convertible version that the luggage capacity figures fall slightly there to 182 liters and 520 liters [Music] from the launch of this 500 hybrid pricing sat primarily in the 13 000 to 16 000 pound bracket reflecting a premium for the electrified technology that fiat says has been kept to around 500 pounds uh there is a significant 2 650 pound model for model premium if you want the alternative 500c version of the same body style with its electric fabric folding roof section here though we're focusing on the normal fixed top three door hatch which in manual form is offered only with the one liter mild hybrid engine what else might you need to know about range structure here well there are five mainstream trim levels pop lounge sport star and rockstar and at the time of this test in mid-2020 fiat was still offering the old four-cylinder 1.2 litre petrol power plant to buyers who want to pay the 630 pound premium that's necessary to get the brand's semi-automatic clutchless dual logic gearbox for reference the hot hatch a bath version of this model which uses a much older but much faster 1.4 liter petrol turbo engine and which isn't our focus here costs from just over 17 000 pounds on to the value proposition represented by 500 model range pricing as a whole now you might think that the most obvious rival to this car is the mini hatch three door but actually that's these days a slightly bigger and more powerful car which is much less efficient than a 500. in its least powerful mini one 102 brake horsepower guys pricing for that mini pretty much starts where the figures for this fiat finish there aren't any other small hatch competitors which quite replicate the retro style package that fiat offers here the volkswagen beetle and the ds3 they're both no longer in production and anyway like the mini hatch they were slightly larger pricier cars vauxhall's adam model was closer but that's now dead and gone too which in terms of competitors to this fiat leaves us only with three-door versions of more mundane city cars and there aren't many of those around these days either to try to replicate what fiat's offering here you could conceivably buy a three-door version of either the volkswagen up the toyota igo uh the citroen c1 or the pojo108 and then add a few trendy touches from the options list but the end result there still wouldn't be quite the same as what you got from a 500 still if you are minded to try to do that you'll want to know that base three-door versions of the vw up and the peugeot 108 cost about the same as this fiat but a citroen c1 might save you a couple of thousand and a toyota i go up to 3 000. ultimately though there's nothing quite like this fiat and if you've come to that conclusion too then you're going to need to know just how generous fiat has been with the standard specification now base pop trim includes well the basics although it does these days include air conditioning and a dab radio as well as a speed limiter and powered mirrors upgrade yourself into lounge trim and it all gets a bit nicer at this level you get the height adjustable driver seat and the 50 50 split folding rear bench that rather mainly pop trim makes you do without lounge spec also gives you a couple of crucial features rear parking sensors which you really need with the restricted over the shoulder view and the seven inch uconnect live center dash infotainment screen package too now this includes voice recognition apple carplay and android auto smartphone mirroring there's also a dab audio system bluetooth hands-free calling music streaming and an sms reader that will read out your text messages to you lounge spec also includes 15-inch alloy wheels a fixed sunroof front fog lights cruise control and the steering wheel that is trimmed in man-made techno leather want more then your fiat dealer will happily oblige mid-range star spec adds automatic climate control and a chrome kit to embellish the exterior styling or you could go for the more dynamic looking sport model which has a sports kit including a rear spoiler side skirts and a chromed exhaust along with body colored sports bumpers 15-inch satin graphite alloy wheels and a satin graphite finish for the door mirrors too at the top of the range rockstar trim gives you all the features of the star and sport variants but also adds in dark tinted rear windows chrome kick plates and a seven inch tft instrument cluster screen on to options and there are lots of them and now with most variants you'll have to pay extra for that seven inch tft instrument binacle cluster screen which will allow you to better monitor the workings of that mild hybrid engine uh depending on the variant that you've chosen you might also want to consider things like a full leather interior uh climate control dark tinted glass byzanon headlamps an electrochromatic rear view mirror a leather gear knob and chromed kick plates now if you have a car with a fixed sunroof you can pay extra at the top of the range to have that feature instead electrically powered a full range of mopar accessories include things like door mirror trims distinctive side badges and vintage style wheel trims and a tailgate rack is also available with two systems for transporting winter sports equipment like skis and snowboards you can also have a luggage compartment net a car cover and a tow bar to widen your choices when it comes to specifying the exterior look of your 500 fiat has introduced a range of body wrappings all available as part of what it calls a second skin personalization program now there are two main options here the simplest of which applies to both 500 body styles and gives you a fashionable geometric pattern along the belt line of the car larger second skin options apply only to the hardtop 500 model and they cover the pillars and the roof and in some cases the bonnet and tailgate as well five main patterns are offered geometric now that's described as an ethnic pattern scotty that's classic tartan a for the fashionable military look comics in red or yellow that's a pop decoration finish which works in combination with two color paintwork and shades which finishes your 500 in either tech house grey bossa nova white or smooth mint if you don't want to go quite as far as sticking body wrappings all over your car then your dealer will be happy to offer you a whole range of stripes and sticker sets with for the roof a special checkered sticker design or an italian flag stripe if you like the idea of either of those there are sport packs in red white or black which include stickers mirror covers and key fob colors in one of those three chosen shades having a red black or ivory contrast painted roof is another option there's a choice of personalized ignition keys and you might want to look at things like chromed bonnet trim larger 16-inch alloy wheels branded side rubbing strip and red brake calipers before you finish the whole thing off with your choice from what is these days a much wider body color palette offering a choice of metallic tri-coat or pastel paint finishes we've got dew green metallic here onto safety now you don't get any of the latest electronic camera-based features that are now creeping onto rival models but all the basics are very much in evidence so even the cheapest trim level gives you twin front side and curtain airbags plus a driver's knee bag there's esc stability control plus anti-lock brakes with hba that's hydraulic brake assistance to help him panic stops and those will be advertised to following motorists by automatically activating hazard warning lights on top of that you get fiat's asr and msr traction control systems tire pressure monitoring and a hell holder clutch too to stop you from drifting backwards on that pill junctions it all justifies this car's five-star euro end cap safety test [Music] rating [Music] one of the advantages of a small car like this is that a tiny fuel-efficient little engine is more than adequate to haul it around a power plant like the mild hybrid one liter firefly unit now primarily fitted to this 500 the electrified system used here recovers energy during braking and deceleration and stores it in a lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 11 amp hours and uses it to restart the engine in stop and start mode and to assist it during acceleration now this technology allows the internal combustion engine to switch off at speeds below 18 miles an hour at which point a dash display prompts the driver to shift into neutral if you can't be bothered to do that in traffic you won't get the full potential benefits of the electrified technology here which fiat ambitiously claims can improve emissions by up to 30 percent that's difficult for us to verify since the industry has switched to a different wltp system for rating emissions since the last time that we tested this car uh the actual quoted figure is up to 119 grams per kilometer combined cycle fuel economy is quoted at up to 53.3 mpg which certainly isn't a 30 improvement the miles hybrid propulsion unit works with a six-gear manual transmission aimed at improving fuel economy in out of town driving that's thanks to new low friction bearings and gaskets and the use of a specific high efficiency lubricant if you don't like this rather bulky stick shift then your fiat dealer can offer you the old dual logic semi-automatic although at the time this test in mid 2020 that could only be had paired with the old four-cylinder 1.2 litre petrol engine which is nothing like as efficient for reference the stats for a 500 1.2 litre dual logic are 47.1 mpg and up to 136 grams per kilometer if you have a model with this instrument cluster screen then you'll get a selectable graphic showing the flow of energy either back into the battery when you're slowing down or to the wheels when you're accelerating there is also a selectable power charge screen and there's an eco index readout on the center dials outer rim now that grades you on acceleration on deceleration on speed and gear shifting for every trip and you can analyze your eco index score in more detail in an eco drive section of the uconnect center dash infotainment screen there that assumes uh that the version of the sphere that you've chosen has that feature now this assesses your driving style in real time and it'll give you tips to improve it that could improve fuel consumption by up to 16 percent an included leaf symbol more graphically shows the extent of your drive and frugality what else uh well service intervals there are every 9 000 miles or every 12 months whichever comes around first and that servicing needn't be too costly because fiat parts are relatively cheap a range of mopar easy care maintenance plans allow you to budget ahead for servicing costs for up to five years what else uh while this car certainly should be cheap to ensure uh ratings range between groups eight to nine depending on the trim level that you choose residual values are better than you might expect them to be on a small affordable fiat if not quite as good as you get from a rival mini uh expect most 500 banks to hold on to around 40 percent of their value after three years that's provided you don't go too mad with options of course what else might you need to know uh well it's disappointing that feared hasn't followed the lead of its brand partner jeep and offering a five-year warranty on its cars here you get three years but at least it is an unlimited mileage package uh free of the sixty thousand mile limit that applies to some rivals uh now you can extend that to five years at extra cost plus there's 36 months of breakdown cover included as well should you have a problem on a journey you can use the uconnect infotainment system to contact roadside assistance and the same setup can also be used to book routine services too this second generation fiat 500 breezes into its third decade on sale with as much self-confidence as it had back in 2007. if you're to want one though you need to be clear about what you're getting here as ever it's unapologetically small so all the same issues in areas like boot space and rear seat accommodation they still remain and the engine now provided for all its hybrid badging isn't really that electrified at all we're okay with both those things and we think many likely customers will be too the diminutive size continues to make this fiat perfect for dinky city motoring and because there's just a light dusting of electrified tech here prices have been able to remain pretty much as accessible as they were before now that is just as well given the premium price tag which has been applied to the alternative new 500 full battery-powered model other issues well of course it would be surprising if a design dating back to the naughties didn't show its age in some areas and you certainly sense that elderly provenance in terms of things like gear shift feel and ride quality if you switch into this car from a more recently evolved city car or super mini but typical cinquecento customers really don't tend to care too much about things like that they'll continue to love the cheeky looks the friendly feel and the wide scope for personalization and thanks to the addition of that mild hybrid power plant there's no longer the feeling that you're putting up with an old nail beneath the bonnet to get all that trendy tinsel in summary then this car remains as likable as ever choosing a fashionable little runabout can often be a risk here though is one you can enjoy without a worry [Music] you

Some of my daughter&#39;s mates own one, but by now the the 2 cylinder POP is quite popular here, nor many 1 2s left on our roads.. On principal I stayed away, Fiat is known to be higher maintenance cars here in South Afica. So for my daughter&#39;s, one wanted a Chevy Spark. Four years later we have only done oil and filters and a battery. For my youngest we got a Honda Brio auto. Also a car that we can rely on, for late night returns to her flat.

fd10 for the links in the description below hello and welcome to Furious driving and today I'm at the wheel of possibly the best used car by and specifically if you're looking for a first car for a teenage driver this might be the one for you this is a 2011 VF 500 oh by the way if you like reviews of new cars old cars retro cars interesting weird cars please hit like and did subscribe now one with the video now the 500 has been around since 2007 and Incredibly and I mentioned this in the previous V 500 video when I drove a very very high spec one it was actually designed by a guy called Frank Stevenson who is one of the automotive design great who also designed the R50 mini the original new Mini so that was quite an incredible accomplishment that he had the two biggest selling small cars in the world basically on sale side by side as Rivals at the same time which is quite a remarkable feat really isn't it he's also the guy who brought us the Ferrari uh 360 and really kind of well evolved the lifestyle SUV segment in Europe to what we have today with the first BMW X5 which he designed in a week so yeah bit of a design great and this is a lot of design goodness going on so why am I telling you that this is the best used car out there and you should buy this for your 17-year-old I know from the comments and also from also the statistics in the back end of YouTube I love a lot of you guys watching this are of an age when you have got 17 18 year old kids who are looking for a first car and things are different from when I was a 17-year-old it's no long find a 3 or 400 lb car and learn to fix it yourself they want a bit more these days they want working airon they want airbags they want all the good stuff that we never have and that costs money well except if you've got one of the bestselling cars of the last decade and a half it doesn't have to cost too much this little F 500 just sold for, 1500 and it's only got 89,000 M on it and a full service history new time and built new clutch recently tires everything you want really in a secondhand car but the thing about the 500 is you get an awful lot of style bang for your buck there are so many nods to the original 500 from the 50s it is just brilliant this body color dashboard area which looks like the painted metal Dash from the original it's actually plastic now which is an awful lot safer we got this retro style radio here in the center it's a matte finished plastic as are these air vents CU so they too look kind of retro and uh old school the car we're driving today is is a 1.2 Lounge which is probably one of the most popular uh option specs you can find of these cars if you type in 1.2 if you type in 500 1.2 Lounge just going automatically sell fills in Google it's that popular under the Bonnet is a 1.2 L 8 valve engine and the platform and indeed the engine is the same as what you'll find underneath the Ford KA from the same generation in fact the new Ford was actually promo in the Bond film of that year was Skyfall as they had done with the Mondo back in Cena Royale anyway so this car is basically the Ford KA well the Ford KA is basically this car either way it's a good platform the differences are though the Ford is a taddy bit more practical they've not gone with the Retro styling cues so you've got a more modern more practical dashboard you got a slightly bigger boot because they've taken out the spare wheel and for well basically legendary handling Department have breathed on the suspension so you get a little bit less bounce in the ride and a little bit more control in general let's pull over and have a little look around the exterior and the interior of this thing so styling wise is a fantastic nod to the ' 50s original don't want to call it a pasti but there is so much visual reference material that comes back to the old car the radiator Grill is down here but we've got this little mustach in chrom and badge which gives the car its face and even in the headlights we also got like a little eyelash thing going on as well you can see why these cars are so cute like the original it's got a face that smiles at you you can see why people love them and also like the original the wheels are pushed out to the corners giving lots of internal space and lots of fun handling as well very short Bonnet very short overhangs lots of glass area and just enough detail to make it interesting to look at and looking down the side of the car the tumble home the way it kind of spreads out at the bottom gives a sturdy solid look on the road also now I apologize about the guy with the shmmer he just started up but around the back there are lots more other references to the original 500 the shape of the tail lights this big Chrome plint above the bumper with a 500 logo stamped or molded into it the big retro style theat badge on the back of it the design team did not want to put a spoiler on it cuz they didn't like the look of it in terms of the Retro field but adding the spoiler here reduces the drag coefficient from 40 CD down to 32 CD so just this little molding here massively massively improves the car's fuel economy I gu stability a bit as well in the back of the car it is relatively practical for such a small car it's not a bad size boot to be perfectly honest ridiculously tiny little parcel sha and the seats fold 50/50 so it is kind of useful and it's even got a space saver spare wheel in the back well the interior really is a fantastic retro Fest if you love mid-century styling or just things looking a bit cool quirky and different this is the car for you the Ford KA is probably the more sensible option but this just looks so good we've got a fantastic stick t- shelf area that dashboard goes on forever you can even stand a tall Cup on there no problem at all speaking of cup holders it has got four cup holders in it's two here in the front and two here in the back when I first saw them I thought they're going to be absolutely useless cuz they're too shallow but they grip this cup really well I've been throwing through corners and not a drop has spilt anywhere so fantastic news there anyway the dashboard let's go back to that it's a two-ton fa so we've got a dark gray on the top of the dashboard which extends into the door car as well it's like a hard texture plastic is not the nicest thing to touch but it looks kind of okay but then we've got lots of other colors going on to break it up we've in this particular car we've got a contrast of blue padded Fabric in the doors which matches the blue padded fabric obviously in the seats looks really cool and the top half of the seats are white vinyl with these cool little round indented headrest as well and that white vinyl matches the a posts as it goes up into the ceiling so we've got three tones going on incidentally we've also got the tweeters up there in the aost as well and the main speakers down in the door which also have some fairly good size door bins as well as well as a solid door pull and this really cool chrome door pull looks really nice obviously very retro again but very cool indeed as we said out on the road we have got this body color panel here on the dashboard as well Fe are very much the master of this they did it in the cop as well looks fantastic there looks amazing here we've got the stylized 500 logo here on the dash as well looks brilliant and of course we got Chrome bzel air vents here on the left and the right in the center as we said we've got the Retro style radio MP3 player CD player curiously though no steering wheel controls on the wheel but we do have a white steering wheel not many cars can uh claim to have that I don't know how clean that would stay but this one's got what 90 or thousand miles on it still looks pretty fresh quick horn test while we're here a a cute 50 style pop actually it's not really 50 Style a real 50 style it's got more of a high pitch tone to it but it's a good effort nonetheless and I love the detailing in the steering wheel we've got the black concave area we've got the Chrome ring then we've got the badge itself it's all so much detail going on and of course we've got the matching cream stalks for the lights indicators and wipers behind it as well and behind that we've got this fantastic kind of stacked layered instrument panel with the mileage the time the fuel gauge that kind of stuff all lurking in there in the LCD then we've got the rev counter on the black dial and then the outer concentric circle is the speed it's a great little piece of design so much information packed into such a small area and doing it so attractively great font as well love a bit of nice fontographer and that of course is also bezel in this nice white color to match the steering wheel and the stalks over to the left again we've got very few other controls we've got this panel here also matching the radio and a matte cream plastic so it looks nice as well but only three other controls on the top of the dashboard the city button hazard lights and fog light lights stepping onto this little plin underneath we've got big big buttons for the electric windows we've got the short throw Snappy gearshift because it's so high up it's a really short throw so it's really fun to just snap through and I love the the black kind of eight ball uh gear knob on top as well looks really good lift to go into reverse bit of Chrome on there looks fantastic thing I don't like though is this ashtray litter bin thing I think is a little bin rather than ASR it's only soft plastic but that nub just there does just constantly rub against your leg so if you're over 5 and 1/2 ft tall it is an issue heading back we got the two cup holders we got a 12vt socket down there proper manual handbrake but next to it is the lever for raising and lowering the seat height and more than once in my short time in this car I have reached over and missed a handbrake and raised all over my seat rather than doing the handbrake which is a little bit awkward and looking underneath the dashboard we have got a huge huge recess of a subt shelf no actual glove box but that subt shelf goes back for miles down there quite hard plastic key again and a little tiny cubby just here on driver's side as well looking some more at the seats themselves they've got the nose pattern of the car that little kind of mustache with the badge in the center pattern simplified and stamped into the seat backs which looks really really cool I love as I say the two-tone Tombstone design looks really nice to get in the back big lever there pull that forward and the seat rolls forward however but once we're in here for some of my height it is a little bit uncomfortable you really do need to to raise up these headrests otherwise that just digs in your back it's not much in the way of nim quite good in terms of foot space I can lift my feet up so they're not trapped under which really is claustrophobic feeling if you have to deal with your toes trapped under the chair as well not much room for my knees not much room for my elbows although there is that recess with the speaker in it which makes a bit of a difference and the little non-opening windows and my head is actually touching into the corner of the ceiling so not the best for someone who's like well adult size here in the back of the car we also have the absolute dinki little parel sh you ever did [Music] see now the Retro styling is kind of a love it or hate it thing but I'm guessing people do generally love it because they sold a million of them by 2013 that's just 6 years and then the next 3 years they sold something like 175,000 cars a year in Europe alone so yeah they are relatively relatively popular if you say I'm going to go look for a f 500 right now unless You' got the curtains drawn you can probably see one which does mean finding one for sale isn't too hot now let say love it or hate it on styling I think the Retro styling looks really really good and it is very very cute however if you've got a 17-year-old lad who is a bit worried about being seen as a bit girly it may be an issue he does not want to be driving this because let's face it there if you get the wrong color on this thing it can look a weed bit girly and I know in this modern era we shouldn't be calling things for boys or for girls but but the reality is that people do still think that way even in the metal there are certain things that do feel like is engineered perhaps more a little bit for girls steer whe doesn't move back and forth only up and down and uh it is way too close to me also um the thing I first found when I drove these cars years ago is that this little plin that the gear ship sits on is too close to my left leg so I'm constantly knocking my left knee and front Shin onto it and so after a long drive on a twisty Road I could have quite a bruised up leg um if you're a smaller person with less of you uh it wouldn't be such a problem but I do find the ashr thing that pops out just crazes against me quite a lot and the height of the seat is is very high basically uh it's designed I guess for people who aren't very tall to sit high up in the car it does have a lowering lever here but it only drops the back of the chair the front of your legs are still at the same height which just makes it slightly awkward to reach the pedals and the pedals are quite a way off the floor almost as if they've been designed to be driven in heels so although it's not a gender specific car a lot of features do appear to be engineered to be driven by women but in terms of driving it is a very very easy car to drive the steering has a little bit of weight in the power assistance we do of course have F City button there which makes things really really light I mean personally I find it alarmingly light we don't have any steering controls on the wheel which a little bit strange a car this new but sitting so high up we do have excellent visibility all the way around the car in this big glass area it's a really really short Bonnet so parking is easy but thing's only 3 and 1/2 M long and 1.6 M wide so finding a parking space for it never going to be a problem and we've got this lovely 5-speed manual gear boox as well which is beautifully snicky other engines do come with a six-speed manual and there was of course an automatic option as well but so is this the ideal first car for your teenage son or daughter Bo just a cheap secondhand car for yourself honestly yeah I think it probably is it ticks so many boxes so well it drives really well it doesn't drive as well as the KA perhaps but it's still rewarding enough most people aren't going to push the envelope from it's handling and really experience the edge of its limits it's more than competent enough and very enjoyable a look 1.2 is not the fastest thing 0 to 60s at 12 1/2 seconds 13 some people say even top speed is 99 which is more than enough it's incredibly Frugal all the engine options are really good on MPG this one I believe has 45 to the gallon with 1.2 in it production of the internal combustion 500 has now technically ended the 500e is replacing it in the inexorable March of EVS but due to well lack of demand basically slow sales especially in Italy and with older drivers they uh they were bringing back a hybrid version of the new 500 oh look a 500 they are literally everywhere you cannot move for these things I've got to be honest I do really like these they're different they're interesting there are too many Bland and unexciting cars on the road so something with a little bit of design flare a bit of excitement and interest in The Styling really does go a long way to liveing up the road scene around us so what if is hawking back to the 1950s 1950s Style is cool guess my brilliant M vendor own mid-century Brilliance into your driveway one thing we haven't done is a brake test so emergency

a new Fiat 500 convertible Dolce Vita mild hybrid prices start from around 19 000 pounds power comes from a one liter three cylinder petrol engine that produces 70 horsepower and 19 newton meters of torque it uses a six-speed manual gearbox and has a combined fuel consumption of 58.9 miles per gallon CO2 figures 109 grams per kilometer zero to 62 miles per hour takes 13.8 seconds and it has a top speed of 104 miles per hour now as you probably know the theater 500's been around for a while now let's just say the good news is it fit just keep on tweaking it you know a tweaked facelift uh better Interiors in you know the entertainment uh screen glove compartment things like that they haven't strayed away I suppose really I win informally and I say that because let's be fair there's a lot of fit 500s on the road now with this I really want to see how the six-speed gearbox because there's nothing wrong the previous version um five-speed version I was thinking yeah six people probably kill the Redstone on the motorway let's just say better I cannot knock heads I found changed it that much the overall design the dashboard phase here the switch gear you know the fact that you always feel this is n't quite high up seat obviously adjusted for me I've got okay my knees are just about touching um the seat here but apart from that my feet can go underneath the seat you've got to have the head restraint up otherwise it would be like in my back some head restraints there like that um and obviously even though this is the convertible loads of Headroom I've got a little kind of armrest to the side as well yeah I could okay I'm not the tallest person around but I could sit in the back of this behind myself driving that makes sense you know what I mean um divisibility which is absolutely brilliant um not as good because this is the convertible version so obviously it's not as good as the normal 500 I'm looking at the room and see exactly what's behind me obviously low door seals lots of glass big steering wheel big light steering wheel especially if you put it in um it's as well the steering you could just spit still around one finger position at a gear stick which is just e you know your arm just sits on top there it's quite a precise okay going up through the gears but apart from that you know how everything feels and and how it drives all the switch gear everything's just to touch everything's nice and close and easy to read it's funny because inside it's roomy and said before I you know the armrest here with the door I am not squashed in this car at all so when it comes to you know City driving to and from work things like that perfect it's pretty absolutely brilliant for doing that now with this card because it's the hybrid mode very Intrigue that obviously it keeps on flashing up with you know to change gear up or down it does a little indicator but there's also a n that pops up where it basically just wants me to go into neutral effectively what you're doing then is recharging the battery so it's quite clever really so it's not like a plug-in hybrid or anything like that it's got a lot of battery and that's all internal helping with the engine apart from that driving this car feels pretty much exactly the same as the previous version the little 1.2 you know short wheel base so it Bops over the bumps and things like that um very easily to be to be fair this kind of environment is where the Fiat 500 comes into its own in City mode with the steering so it's all nice and Light negotiating small little Villages towns City centers like this easily because I could just nip in and out of the gaps and what have you it's nice and easy he does that for me thank you and I just travel on down let's see what it's like on the neighbor Road s quite well through the gears obviously to a certain extent it's not going to set the world on fire is it but there's more than enough there it's no above put it that way let's not try it again through the gears through these corners Andrew calls well so before it's not gonna you know you know set the world on fire but you're not really buying this car to do that are you basically buying it to drive it hey because you like the way it looks how it makes it feel um the size of it the price the fact that it's pretty much straightforward with that little bit of Italian cheeky Flair which we all gotta like with this you know quick drive review of the new fit 500 hybrid yeah it's just another tweak that fear have done to make this car obviously relevant more fuel efficient quieter because I mean yeah I'm in sixth gear now it's happy put it on here but really you know it's in time it's where this car really excels and you know still puts a smile on my face these seats which you know they are beautiful they're really nice to look at really nice looking out they're comfortable cannot knock them at all you know um yes I could do a long journey in this quite easily um it's what can I say it's still relevant and I suppose with a matter of hundreds that are actually on the road that's testable really isn't it that is tested anyway what I'm saying is if you're looking for a small car have a look at one of these anyway I hope you enjoyed this video if you did give it a little bit of a thumbs up subscribe to we blog any coffee I'm already if you have thank you very much and as I always say whatever you're driving I really hope it's enjoyable take care and I'll see you for the next video bye for now

brand new generation new platform fully electric 500 e but until then and even beyond then with this generation of 500 this hybrid version will be the only one that you can buy but even though it's got hybrid on the end of the name it's not actually a hybrid in the way that you might think we're going to explain why later but for now let's talk about the outside so is there anything to point out to make this different from what it was before well there are two things at the back and on the side you've got these hybrid badges but really apart from that the design is the same as before and ever since this car went on sale in 2007 it became an instant icon a huge sales success for Fiat really transformed the brand and they haven't really done too much to the design since then and I suppose why would you if you've got a winning formula selling loads of cars and you probably don't want to tweak it too much so you've got this cutesy headlight design at the front it's still got those compact dimensions and a shape that makes it look really similar to the original Fiat 500 from the 1950s but apart from those badges that are pointed out there's really nothing different to report from the design it's the same Fiat that we've known since 2007 but is there anything different inside now we're actually in a 500 CE so I'm going to move the roof back to let you get a better view of the new seats in this 500 hybrid launch edition trim because they have a kind of fancy design and supposedly 10% of it is made from recycled sea waste so 1.5 kilograms of plastic bottles and other rubbish that idiots have thrown in the sea have been used to help make the four seats that you get in the Fiat 500 so that is a very noble thing to do if that is true it's what Fiat says and other manufacturers are starting to do things like that as well as for the rest of the interior it's identical from what you had before the only difference being on the digital driver display you now have some battery specific information that it displays for you there otherwise the materials used are a reasonable quality they're not particularly plush but neither are they offence cheap feeling and also what Fiat does pretty well is it allows this customization of this kind of dashboard panel here so you can have some interesting colors there so it helps just lift the perceived quality of the interior whereas other rivals can feel a bit drab and dark and not very interesting but fits always managed to make its interiors at least look vaguely appealing the buttons here though are starting to feel a bit old and on the cheap side but it's good that you do have buttons to control the air conditioning that they're not lost within a very fiddly touchscreen infotainment system because up here this isn't very good to use the infotainment system you get with the Fiat 500 it's got a confusing layout these buttons are a bit small and you do have a volume control there and something for the radio on the other side but it still would just be so much easier if you had either bigger touchscreen shortcut buttons or physical buttons you do though at least get the chance to have apple carplay and android auto with the 500 which is very welcome but elsewhere these buttons actually feel pretty good quality the space up front is okay if you're especially tall you're going to be pretty cramped in this city car space in the back really isn't much to write home about compared to its rivals and this is only available as a three-door which might mean that it looks cool but makes getting in and out of the back particularly awkward and a boot well that is absolutely tiny compared to its rivals as well but how is this car on the road okay so now we are in central Bologna testing the Fiat 500 Hybrid and how it drives so the first thing you notice when you get in this car is the driving position because for a city car you do sit very high so you have this kind of bus driver driving position with this what feels like a massive steering wheel with this huge bit in the middle and a kind of awkward placement for the pedals too so it just means that you've got a relatively uncomfortable angle for your feet especially for the clutch so that isn't brilliant but one good thing about the driving position is this gear box down here because it's pretty high up on the dashboard and it just means it's within very easy reach when you need to change gear so that is good the gear box itself I actually quite like to because in some other city cars they have manual gearboxes that are incredibly slick and quick shifting but the problem with that is is they feel kind of slippery so if you are doing an enthusiastic gear change it feels like you going to throw it through the dashboard or something but on the Fiat 500 the shifts are more deliberate mechanical feeling so I actually quite like that now we run cobbled streets right now as you can probably hear from my voice and the suspension is coping relatively well with it but it doesn't have the kind of sophisticated ride that you get from other city cars but I mean we're talking about a very old car now so the Fiat 500 was reimagined and released in 2007 but the platform that it's based on actually goes back to when the Fiat Panda was released in 2003 so that's incredibly old now with city cars there's not much profit to be made from them so it doesn't really make sense as a manufacturer to have a business model where you're constantly refreshing your city cars constantly giving them new platforms which is why a lot of other rivals also take their time when they're introducing facelifts or changing the platform but for some context in the same time that the Fiat 500s been around behind our i-10 which is a city car that's always been near the top of the class that's had three pretty comprehensive refreshes and now it's in a new generation as well and it's always been very impressive so the Fiat 500 feels a bit off the pace and the ride is one of the areas in which you can notice it but we're in town obviously in Italy as well so the very very most natural of habitats for the Fiat 500 and it's fine there's nothing that really makes it very uncomfortable or awful in any respect but it's just that the other better rivals in this class that all cost similar money do everything better it doesn't excel in the way that you'd be hoping for so a keeper canto and a Hyundai i10 are both better to drive more comfortable more practical they've got nicer interiors the engines are more impressive and in fact the same goes for the Volkswagen Arps go to City go and the semi - and if you're interested in the hybrid side of things well the Suzuki Ignace again is a better car and offers a really really impressive hybrid system that makes it a very very fuel-efficient car and also there are now very good versions of City cars that are fully electric like the me electric like the city go II so considering that they are quite a step up in price from the 500 hybrid maybe they might not be for everyone but now more than ever they're more compelling choices in this class so apart from this car being a 500 and it having a styling and everything else that goes with owning a Fiat 500 there isn't really anything else to outright make it a very recommendable car so let's discuss the mild hybrid technology in the 500 now it really is pretty cheeky and a bit of a stretch to put hybrid on the end of this 509 because this is not a car that you can plug in it isn't a car that can travel on pure electric power alone all it is is a tiny electric motor and a miniscule lithium-ion battery that together store up energy when the car is braking or decelerating to then use again when it's accelerating so all of that helps slightly improve performance fuel economy and reduce co2 emissions so all pretty useful things not necessarily to be sniffed at but can you really call this a hybrid it seems a bit cheeky especially when we're in an era where lots of car buyers are just a bit overwhelmed and confused by all these different terms we have for plug-in hybrids hybrids self charging hybrids whatever that means be v's it just seems a bit unfair to market this as a hybrid so is there a noticeable impact on the performance of the engine thanks to smart harbour technology well I'm in third gear dropping down to 2,000 revs flooring it the full 69 brake horsepower really the acceleration never feels urgent it feels pretty gutless and also it's a weedy engine and it doesn't sound very nice either so if you do want to go anywhere quickly you've got to be flashing it quite hard and when you do you get this kind of harsh engine note quite a lot of vibration through the pedals as well it's not an awful engine to listen to but again if you just compare it to the three cylinder units that you can get in the key of a canto the honed i-10 they're just nicer more refined and more powerful and impressive as well now this is a city guard so obviously it's quite small but having said that if you enter a corner with a bit of pace then the amount of body roll that it generates is really quite surprising and it doesn't feel anywhere near as nimble or composed as its rivals it doesn't have a feeling of agility the steering it's okay it's not very communicative but the weighting of it isn't necessarily an issue it's also got this handy button down here which you can put in city mode which is basically massively lightens the steering so takes all of the weight out of it so that it makes parking lot easier but you definitely don't want to turn it on when you're driving normally because it feels really very strange but in normal mode the steering has a acceptable weight to it it's still not as nice and is responsive and alert as a Volkswagen up certainly that's a much nicer car to drive that was what you need to know about the new

I have had a fiat as a second car since 1987 and they have always performed well. No, as the new 500 is testement to they go the distance. Look how many are still around after 15 years. Fiat have sold ove 3,000,000 500‚Äôs and there is a reason for that. It fits its market perfectly, it has something that far East cars would die for and that is it equals more than the sume of its parts. A little like Alfa it has what the French call Je ne sais quoi, a certain something that is hard to put your finger on but it puts a smile on your face every time you drive it. That retroesque interior, small but comfy enough for two people. Its economical but the performance is adequate for what it is. I have bought one and I just look for an excuse to take it for a run. I could never say that about any of the BMW, yes the look good in the office car park or down the pub and yes most perform well but since the E30 model they have lost their way, anaomus Hyundai clones.

hatchback from the 50s has now unfortunately evolved into a middle-class mobile beauty salon driven by people who like to sunbathe a lot what we have here today is the 2016 model with the facelift although it's not as pretty as the original 3500 it still has its similar characteristics the shape of this car is very reminiscent to the original it's still got that very rounded silhouette and it's very pug like face in fact it's the same with the engine it's got a small 1.2 liter petrol engine which produces some horsepower it's also got some similarities in the interior too obviously it's a bit more modernized but still very minimal you get a few standard features like radio bluetooth and voice control and that's about it so the 2016 model holds up pretty well to the original apart from it being the size of a five bedroom house in surrey what's it like to live with now first of all let's talk about how this thing drives now straight away it's not a particularly big chore to drive this thing compared to the original but at the same time it does lack the character the original one had as well it's quite boring now it's not particularly fast either as you'd imagine um it's more sort of set up for the town and city driving which is perfectly fine because it is more than good in this style of driving anyway [Music] now if you want to get the most out of this you really do have to drive it like a european and that means redlining it every single gear now the visibility isn't the best to be quite honest but that doesn't really bother the owners because they're more preoccupied with other things i've got a text [Music] so driving then no good what about practicality i'm speaking to you now from a pair of fake ray bans carrying a fake louis vuitton bag in which we find some fake makeup accessories and if we consult my fake iphone we can see it's 23 probably which means it's time to pop into the fake starbucks over there for a cup of fake coffee [Music] so as you can see i put my fake handbag on the passenger seat along with the hairdryer and my very nice sparkly purse i put my makeup in my lap because well that's where it usually goes and my fake coffee in the many cup holders the car offers and finally the iphone in between the steering wheel and the dials that's successful then i was also rather impressed with the interior mirror now the mirrors in this car are actually quite good i mean you can see quite a lot and i think the only thing i can really see the use of them for is the makeup of course oh wait i should have done that whilst driving next it was time to test the business of parking now this is still a pretty small car so it should be quite easy to park and i'm not testing it in a middle-class housing estate as you might expect it to be um instead i'm going to try at a well multi-story car park and if you think 500 drivers are well incompetent as it is they've actually got a button here which when you press makes the steering lighter wow that is light and it should be well and absolutely bruised apart which it is that's part of that test [Music] so is there anything i actually like about it yes in fact the ride is rather smooth it's got pretty soft suspension the seats are pretty comfortable they're a nice leather and there's decent room in the back in fact it's also got a sunroof which i rather like because it's you know means you can get a tan in the week whilst driving to work so there we are that's the 2016 500 and what it's like living with it if you did enjoy this video then make sure you like and subscribe to us on the channel and obviously follow us on all social medias right back to starbucks oh it's got a race mode [Music] camera rolling um do you want to turn that little light out hold please

Yes I like how you presented the car and yes I also like the car the price instead is a bit, just a bit exaggerated, in Europe you find this model between 13-16 thousand maybe even better, but only for short walks and going out with girls, so, you can&#39;t use the car for high speeds, for any type of small races or to test its stability, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as stable as it seems, and I don&#39;t know what to say about the reliability of the car ...

a new video today i'm right here in burn at bellevue centrum in burn if you know that uh if you didn't know i will leave the link in the description so you can check them out and i have with me the new fiat 500 hybrid the brand new 2020 model and i will test drive it for you guys also i will review it you can see another video the full review so check it out uh but before we start the video i want to show you some technical details and some information about the car and then we will uh make the test drive all right guys so first time i want to show you the technical details um yeah actually here you can check the car out um on belvac point see hush uh you can see the price and all kind of um cars they don't have only fiat they have all other mark as well so yeah check them out okay so we have the 500 uh on this 500 we have the one liter engine with three cylinder 70 horsepower you can see it right here um also you can see the colors and stuff like that so you can make an idea also the co2 emission uh the consumption around six liter this is the um the average consumption also it comes with a manual gearbox with six gear you can see it right here and also here are all the options you can post the video and read it out if you want to the starting price of this new fiat 500 it's 20 000 francs around 90 000 here you can see the pack that we have on this car that i will drive it right now you can see also the price for different uh packs and guys uh they have a great discount these days so if you come at belvag those days uh you will have a discount very very good discount so the price of the car will be 80 000 so much more cheaper than the starting price so uh that's something to to keep in mind so yeah let's start the test drive [Music] all right guys so here we are inside the new fiat 500 hybrid here is the key i just want to show you first time the key it's a pretty interesting key but and uh also it's still have this um classic uh starting um mechanism so um yeah the car it's a manual it comes with this manual six gear shifter so we start the engine something that i like very much is the fact that you can also adjust the steering wheel the way you want it you can do it manually from there so you can choice the position you want to to leave it and also the seats you can adjust it manually from here you can put it down you can put it up you can leave it a little bit backwards the way you want it it's super super simple uh to do that also um the fact that you can customize this new digital screen let me close turn on the climatic system the fact that you can adjust and see the pressure to see the consumption to see uh what was the consumption how much kilometer did you drive how much energy you recuperate back because this is a mild hybrid it has a battery under the front seat uh i will leave it just like that energy flow so you can see the energy flow there i like very much the cockpit i like the visibility right here also the car come with android auto apple car play so you can actually connect your phone without any problem right there it comes also with a manual handbrake so from what i heard this car it's super economical uh in the city and it's also very small you can see how easy i get out from there from the park place if i had a longer bigger car will be much more complicated also i like very much uh first impression i like very much this mirror here wow it's a big mirror you have such a good visibility in the back and also on the windows we have so so so much big windows big mirrors so the visibility it's amazing i mean for the city this is very important to have a good visibility while you're parking uh while you're going on the small streets and stuff like that so i like it also i like very much this roof here guys so you can see it you can open it up and close it just like that and also if i'm not wrong um the you can you can buy another model with the possibility to to open this glass roof here up but on this model it's fixed but you can buy uh as an option also with this roof so you will be able to open it up so that's amazing also i have another review with fiat 500 where you can open uh like cabrio you know you can open all the way the roof until down there so it's super nice for the for the summer also i like very much the way uh it's show you here the speed the energy flow and also all that information the new cockpit it's super super nice i don't know if you can see it but it's it's gorgeous also the steering wheel it's pretty cool the suspension here are some bumps and um the suspension are quite good for a small car like that you can see here a lot of bumps and you don't you don't even feel those bombs that's quite impressive and the fact that the car is super small it's nice and it's very silent this one liter engine uh it is really indeed very silent and i like that and the people that drive this car tell me that it's a very economical car and because of the fact that it's a mild hybrid it's come with a battery that recuperate energy so every time i brake for example right now i brake and every time i brake um the car will bring back some energy in the battery and then it will help you a lot it will give you i think around five horsepower extra because of the battery so that's really impressive it comes also with some usb port 12 volt port the glow box it's quite big i like also the dashboard it has a nice layout with 500 logo there every button is in the perfect position right here so i like it very much really even here it's soft material on the armrest the seats are great they're gorgeous guys look at the seats they are super super beautiful you have side support also in the back there i will make a full review about the car so you can check it out on my channel but in this video it's all about driving the car and enjoy it here's the bump yeah not bad not bad the suspension the stability until now it feels good i like it i like that the engine is so silent also the navigation here we have a matte screen here it's quite okay it's not the best but quite nice so you have a good visibility right there um when you when you set it out from from here from the driver point of view you have a very good visibility so i can't complain about that also in the night it's quite nice here so you can see the lights are on the car come with cenon light also it has led light on the daylight also it comes with a cruise control so you can set it up from here pretty simple pretty awesome and i like this cockpit it looks super super nice nice colors and resolution it's it's super good and also the insulation from the exterior i feel that it's quite good so for example when you open the you can hear the noise outside when you close the window it's not so much noise it's quite nice i like the way the gear shifter it's quite nice when you change the gears you feel perfectly it goes perfectly in the in the place so sixth super smooth i like how smooth you change the gears we have 80 here the pedals are also quite okay so it feels good also on the highway here even if we drive only 18 almost 19 i think it's doing a great job also the steering wheel it's very soft and it feels quite nice brakes feel quite good as well and the most the thing that impressed me the most until now it is the the visibility on the windows you have such a good visibility um i like this glass roof that comes so much so much light inside the car and it gives you a feeling of of brightness of open space i like the cockpit very much the position of driving those seats are quite comfortable and yeah to be honest i like also the the position of driving even if this is a small car you feel like you are driving a little bit uh higher you know it's not the ground clearance is not so small so you are a little bit higher right here on the on the seat and the mirrors the this mirror here it's it's perfect i mean it's such a good visibility suspension are all so good yeah of course at high speed i think the you can hear some noise from outside it's not perfectly um insulated but it's not bad for example when driving the city 60 we have 60 it's super super silent and smooth on the road and it feels quite good also it show you there how much battery you have and it also show you that graphic when you charge the battery on the curves right here we can try also some acceleration you can drive also a little bit sporty if you want to feel nice it feels nice feeling super nice not bad and it's incredible the suspension and it's incredible the tall driving position i feel like i'm much more taller than in my tesla model 3 for example or in other cars even if this is a small car i still feel like i have a very very tall position here i can test out also this turning circle and the radius let's make only reverse all right reverse is like that so the car doesn't come with a reverse camera but you have such a good visibility on the on the mirrors and on the windows so you don't even need that that's not bad it's not bad at all it's not bad guys really i like the way it feels it feels really good um and it's really really silent also this glass roof it's beautiful anyway let's drive forward guys i will make a full review with it check it out on my channel there you can see uh the interior exterior the quality of the materials and all that stuff um yeah but until then let's try an acceleration from zero and also it's show you when to to change the gear shifter so that's that's quite nice tell you that you have to change the gear right now and you can see it on the screen right there so that's quite nice also here on the curves it stay really good here on the uphill it's trying the engine it's trying a little bit you can feel that doesn't have that power so um yeah when you go probably on the mountain with it on the on the high uphill probably uh it will work a little bit the free cylinders but if you drive in the city if everything is flat it's will don't have any problem with the the engine and this engine it's made special to be economical and i heard the car uh get some amazing amazing consumptions so uh if you have if you want a very good consumption guys i think this is the kind of one of the perfect car to buy for the city and it's beautiful it is a beautiful car give you a nice feeling being inside here very good quality we have leather here with soft fabric material combination and big windows great visibility um it's you feel really good inside inside the car i don't know why i have this feeling but i i just really enjoy driving the car and in the city it's just perfect car just the perfect perfect car of course if you go outside on the highway and you want to drive uh over 100 kilometer per hour probably you will he will try too much with the fury cylinders but that's why i really recommend you uh in the city driving if you want to drive it in the city i think it is perfect it's perfect economical for the city because you don't need so much horsepower you don't need so many cylinders to to take a lot of energy but for the city it is perfect i mean if you go every day uh to the work and you need an economical car this is the one this is the one this new fiat 500 hybrid version it's it's great and as i said the car come with the battery that 12 volt battery that help uh the the engine and help the economy of the car much more and you can see also the energy flow down there on the screen you can also change the screens to see different functions this is something that i like very much um yeah you can see also the actual consumption right there we have the average consumption 2.5 2.2 this is kind of amazing to see those consumption there i'm quite impressed to be honest also you can see how much energy you regenerate there and i want to see that where is that i want to see the consumption guys i mean i'm super super impressed with the consumption uh this car can get some pretty impressive consumption i have one before uh a fiat um an old one and i had some gorgeous gorgeous consumptions on the car and that's something that i will always remember and i'm sure about that you can get some amazing consumption also it's a beautiful day today and with this glass roof i think it's it's gorgeous the feeling it's gorgeous um and also the this a pillar here it's kind of small so that let me have a very good visibility also the maneuver of the car it's it's easy to get uh curves and stuff like that and also to turn the car it's super easy and also the brakes feel really nice and smooth while you're braking the brakes are quite good anyway guys i will make another video with this fiat 500 hybrid um and you can check it on my channel if you didn't subscribe yet just click the subscribe button guys if you want to see uh the full review with this 500 hybrid and there you will find all kind of information the space the material quality here on the dash for example the cockpit i will go into detail a little bit multimedia system and materials the space in the back how much space you have the engine and stuff like that you can see it on my channel so uh don't hesitate guys to subscribe also you can see this glass roof you can see all kind of information about the car and yeah but until now to be honest i'm really impressed with the visibility the big windows the big windscreen in the front the big mirror and in the back i have a great visibility in the mirrors also there um i like the tall driving position even this is a small car i have a very tall driving position and this is this is super impressive to be honest i have such a good visibility man i don't know how how can i explain you but that's something that i like until now and also the suspension i didn't expect to be so good to be honest in the suspension of the car also you have the climatic system here that you can turn it on and off and you can choice the vans the way it should be that's impressive huh the ac it has an ac here super nice here are the blinkers this is the city drive you can see you have here uh a button where you can press this button and when you drive in the city the steering wheel will be much much lighter so right now it is super super light the steering wheel and it's perfect for the city drive oh man i mean i i like it so much and you will see also on the screen there city uh that it's on i think i get on the wrong lane or not yes i think so i think i have to go left here if someone will let me i'll go left yes that way i like the car it's so easy to maneuver and i like this this blinker here it's in the perfect place to say thank you you know what i mean i mean it's it's perfect and now it's red red traffic sign everything is in the perfect position so here you press you go in city off city on and now the the steering wheel it's super light and i like that those are the lights right here super simple turn it on and off the fog light and the fog lamps also i like these vents here on the side they feel so nice they look nice as well it's easy to you have this physical button here and it's very easy to turn it off and on that's something that i like um you don't have to go in touch screen and stuff like that also the car can read the traffic speed limit that's another cool stuff you can see it right here on the navigation so you can see here it say it's 50 of course here is not 50 but it's good to have this information right there on the navigation as well but if you want to see the navigation details and information check out the other video on my channel so anyway so in this traffic um here it's nice to have this car to be honest because it's easy to maneuver and also the pedals are really smooth so you don't have to try too much also the gear shifter it's nice and you can change the gears super super easy the steering will feel really good as you touch it here i will be able to show you again uh the turn radius of the car because i will have much more space here it's a bump yes not bad not bad to be honest not bad at all for the size of the car also you can turn you can see the turning radius it is very very very very small and that's something that i'm i'm super impressed with something that i like very much now anyway guys um [Music] i'm almost finished with the car also going in reverse as i s as i show you before you can go in reverse super easy even if you don't have a reverse camera the mirrors are so big and you are able to to drive back very very very nice and very simple so that's a great great thing um that i like it very much anyway let's go forward again those bumps now we are in the city mode the city mode it's nice that you can get the curves very easy and you need some if you need some power you have it there with you you don't have to worry about that you can see how tall i am if you look at other cars everybody else it's down there somewhere on the ground but i'm having a tall driving position and that's that's quite pleasant i mean i have a good visibility that's nice i'm almost up like dutch a duster i feel on this seat maybe because it's the battery under the seats i have this tall position i can also adjust it of course i can put it down a little bit if i want but i like this position i like the way you see everything from from here i don't want to change it also if i go into menu here the trip you can see also the consumption until now um how can i do that 3p here you can you can reset this i'm not wrong how can i do that wait a second if i hold this i want to reset the trip and maybe to see the consumption i'm really curious about the consumption it's a very busy day today on the street on this street here i see there are so many cars but this kind of traffic you you will expect uh to drive with this car you know like city driving like a lot of traffic and that's the perfect test for the car in my opinion i think he's doing a great job until now and i like the fact that it's very small so you can park it very easy in in many places that's a super positive thing on the car that you are able to park it in very small tight spaces it's a pleasant ride really it's a pleasant ride and even at high speeds for example right now here it's doing quite a good job that's something that i like um about the car about this fiat 500. yeah i go out i go in the trip and i don't know how how can i uh reset these things here i'm really curious about that how can i reset it let's get an error for the tire pressure i will stop anyway the review um in a few minutes and we will check it out but guys i really really enjoyed the car i think they they did a great job with the car i think um it's perfect for the city the gear shifter is nice the suspension are okay the steering wheel it's very light and nice also here on the uphill it's quite okay it is quite nice [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] also here for example you can take some bumps with the car without any problem and all right guys here i will stop the review i think it's more than enough to understand what this car can do and i hope for you guys it's also more than enough to understand what this car can do so uh i want to give you some of my impression about the car in the end i think the car it's perfect for the city of course for the highway you will have some problem because it has only three cylinders and also if i'm not wrong 17 horsepower yes 70 horsepower uh but for the city it's perfect and it makes some amazing consumptions uh the toll position it's nice it's nice that it has a battery under uh the seats here and it helps you with the economy it gives you also extra five horsepower and uh the visibility on the on the windows it's it's amazing i love this glass roof here it's perfect i mean it's it's just the way it should be a small car very easy to to drive very easy to park um it's it's very nice this the the gear shifter it's nice to use the pedals the steering wheel it's really easy and overall it's a nice car with a great price i mean eighty thousand i think seventy thousand it's for example eighty thousand dollars for a new brand new fiat 500 hybrid i think it's a great price uh guys i hope you enjoy the video um also if you are new here please subscribe to my channel if you want to see the full review with the car check it out on my channel i will have a full review interior exterior with the car so you can see there all the details about the car um i hope you enjoy it i hope it was helpful this test drive and stay safe i see you soon in the next one bye guys [Music] you

I feel it&#39;s probably one of the worst cars at the moment... when I see those Clothing Irons buttons in 2023: I urge to vomit. The outside is Okay because the model is all of that quirky and old image . and I hope it doesn&#39;t change much... but the inside and motor: what a disgrace.', 'So there you have it, a report from someone who just doesn&#39;t get &#39;retro&#39; and calls it old fashioned. ü§£', 'Had exactly this model on hire in Lanzarote recently...said all the same things you did- especially, about sitting on it, not in it!

Near me there&#39;s a 5 mile stretch of twisty forest road and the 500 is just as much fun to drive along it as the Caterham. Get the 500c, put the roof and side windows down and it all feels about 10mph faster than it actually is.', 'Just replaced my 2011 1.2 that I&#39;ve had for 10 years with a 21 dolce vita, cos I love the style outside and in. Yes it&#39;s old fashioned looking but that&#39;s part of the charm. The last one at 96k and 12 years old still had the original exhaust and for all its little idiosyncrasies (wing mirror falling/door handles off) I loved it, which is why I bought another', 'Great video - I&#39;ve just been diagnosed with Asperger&#39;s', 'The bodyworks garage gave me a 500 while my Skoda Octavia IV went in for some repairs.  My heart sank when they delivered it.  Compare to my car, this is like a shoebox.   Goodness, it felt cramped.  It also feels rather flimsy.   OK, so this is built for the city and Rome is it&#39;s natural habitat.  But what do people do for long journeys?  Do 500 owners have 2 cars, one for the city and one for long trips on the motorways?  I am glad we drove from London to Glasgow and back in our Skoda, I don&#39;t think I my back would have survived in the 500.  I have to make a trip to Stoke on Trent in a few days, and I am not looking forward to it.  You are right, the infotainment system is very slow and the graphics reminded me of early computer games.  Whether you like the look of the car is personal taste.  Personally, I think it looks like a toadstool and has as much charisma as a snail. I can&#39;t wait to get my Octavia back!<br><br>On a separate note,  what don&#39;t garages give you a manual with loan cars?!  I don&#39;t even know what the tyre pressure should be and I want to check before my long journey.  There are warnings on the dashboard and I don&#39;t know what they relate to.  I Googled it but there are umpteen versions!  I tried calling the garage and no one picks up.', 'I don&#39;t think you&#39;re the target market and you don&#39;t seem to understand why the 500 sells so well.  I rented one for 5 days in Italy and thought it was a great little car with character and would have one if I was in the market for a small car.', 'I have one of these cars everyone loves it and I find the seating height very good for my 56 year old back I mostly drive on very narrow Scottish country roads so the size of the car is perfect agree with all you say but I find the little fiat to be perfect for me keep up the goodwork', '‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see the point in this car, don‚Äôt waste your money‚Ä¶ thank you Fiat UK for the loan‚Äù ü§£ Also, I would hazard a guess that the sales figures tell a very different story, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre still selling them along side the electric only 3rd gen', 'Thanks for the review. We constantly get 60 mpg out of our Star, (16&#39;&#39; wheels) on trips, there no wind noise at 70 mph, handles like a go cart and the ride is comfortable. Yes the gears have to be used but its nippy enough in traffic. The seat fold mechanism is rubbish and feels like its going to break when operating and the windscreen wipers are noisy. Love this little car though.', 'True Review. üòò', 'Had it as Service car, loud engine but low Acceleration. <br>City car? Yes in deed.', 'Should have 90 hp ‚óè!', 'Great review mate! Personally, I agree with everything you say (especially when I joined you for the twin test) it just further reminded me that Fiat 500 is flawed and after 13 years it is certainly showing it&#39;s age<br><br>For a platform that is so &#39;popular&#39; you&#39;d think Fiat would have listened to it&#39;s problems/flaws and adapted it to make it more fresh; instead the only noticeable difference is the price increase and a million different trim levels for no reason!<br><br>For looks, do people really think it is a &#39;stylish&#39; car? If you buying a 500 to celebrate the original that alone is an insult in itself! Plenty of other cars in it&#39;s class that offer better value for your money including actual safety, more refinement and better practicality, not sure why there is even a debate on the subject<br><br>Nevertheless everyone has an opinion, it just happened mine &amp; yours are both the same', 'Conclusion: how long will fossil fuels last? It is predicted that we will run out of fossil fuels in this century. Oil can last up to 50 years,\xa0natural gas up to 53 years, and coal up to 114 years.', 'Nice and honest review. Sells well because it is a bit of an icon. Shame they haven&#39;t updated it much over the years. For an outdated interior it is still pleasant to look at. For a city car it fits the purpose well.', 'We have had two 500 over the past eight years. Used  for nipping into town, busy commute to work by my wife and so forth. That‚Äôs what they do well. They are cheap to own and reasonably reliable. They hold their value second hand. My wife wouldn‚Äôt have anything else. If you want to improve the handling get some decent shocks on the back . They will be far superior to the cheap ones fitted by Fiat .', 'If I were in the market for one I‚Äôd try and find a second hand twin air.

oh no wait no i'm in third [Music] the new fiat 500 is finally here but it is electric only so what if you want a new 500 but you're not quite ready to dive into ev motoring it's okay because fiat can offer you this the new fiat 500 hybrid now why am i doing that well for starters this isn't a new car this particular design has been around for quite a few years now the other reason is because well this isn't strictly a hybrid this is as much a hybrid as i am bayesian i am but very loosely this can't be driven on ev only nor can you plug it in so is this car actually worth it keep watching to find out [Music] under the bonnet i've got a one liter three cylinder naturally aspirated petrol engine which offers 70 horsepower along with 90 newton meters of torque normally at this point i would give you some performance stats but that does seem a little bit irrelevant doesn't it so of course let me speak about fuel economy on a combined run fiat states that this engine can offer up to 53.3 mpg and it emits 119 grams per kilometer this means for the first year of bed you will be required to pay 180 pounds and compared to the old 1.2 liter engine this engine is up to 30 more efficient when it comes to emissions this engine has of course got the help of a mild hybrid system the battery the lithium battery is under the front passenger seat and has got a capacity of 11 amp hours and i said earlier at the performance stats for this car are pretty irrelevant but in case you are wondering this will hit 62 miles per hour in a rather yawn inducing 13.8 seconds and the top speed in case you're really wondering is 104 miles per hour with this car only having 70 horsepower the engine does need to be worked quite hard thankfully this is a city car therefore when you're driving in and around town this engine is just fine bizarrely in my opinion it is mated to a six-speed manual gearbox i may be mistaken but i've driven a few fiat 500 and a bath 595. i think this is the first one i've ever driven with a six speed not a five speed not a complaint just a bit quirky the other quirky thing about this is the driving setup like every other abarth and fiat 500 i've driven you're perched quite high up it almost feels like a small suv for some people that'll be great but for me at six foot two yeah i would like to be sat lower down it feels like i'm sat on the car not in it going back to the six-speed manual i mentioned a few moments ago the changes are okay then nothing special but they're not horrid either the change is relatively assured it falls into place rather nicely although there have been a few occasions where when stationary i've gone for first and in fact got to third so i've set off and gone why have i got no power this engine really is sluggish oh no wait no i'm in third that would explain that one as much as this engine isn't designed for performance or indeed driving pleasure i think it actually makes quite a good noise it's got nice little growl to it because of course it is a three-cylinder unit and the exhaust has got quite a nice thumb to it it sounds a bit old-school in its approach but let's face it this design is a bit old-fashioned now that i'm at um slightly faster speeds let me touch upon refinement as you may hear there is a fair amount of road noise coming into the cabin it isn't deafening but it is there the wind noise isn't too bad though in all fairness now i have driven this on an a road and as you can imagine this isn't the uh the best companion for a motorway cruise not that this car was designed for that kind of thing of course the 500 is a pretty easy car to drive the pedals are nice and light the steering's light although if you want it even lighter you've got a button on the dash and that puts it into sitting mode so all of a sudden you've got really light steering you can just steer it with your fingertips which which will be really handy for navigating tight spaces or multi-story car parks as i demonstrated yesterday when i did the twin test within me electric with fellow youtuber pocket rockets that video may be ready to watch depending on how i've edited the videos how my schedule is now that i'm on a faster road let's see how the 500 handles let me take it out of city mode on the steering so so the 500 hybrid can make progress well enough but you have to be patient i have to be even more patient because i'm now stuck behind an ix 35 i'm sure there are plenty of you that aren't really fussed about the handling you can give a monkeys whether or not it goes around the corner well but oh a bit of a thud there but in case you're wondering the handling is so so the grip is okay the body rolls quite a bit in the corners however fiat has said that because of this new hybrid well mild hybrid power train it has actually lowered the center of gravity for this car therefore it should theoretically have this body roll from my muscle memory from driving previous 500s i don't really notice a difference i think i'd have to drive an older car back to back to really see a clear difference between the two driving styles the fiat 500 of course has a short wheelbase that can be bad news for comfort this car isn't overly uncomfortable it's not too bad in all honesty it's not as comfortable as the say it's me electric i'm also testing this week the me electric has got better the rider's a bit more compliant and a bit less jiggly this is by no means offensive and if you're just driving it around town i'm sure you'll find it just fine it's not the best riding car going but would you expect it to be probably not the seat is quite comfortable but i don't know how it would fare for a longer journey although again i know the car's not really designed for that kind of driving [Music] yeah so in the corners quite a bit of lean a bit of tire squeal as well which is quite interesting because i wasn't going through a corner particularly fast mind you this car will of course be on skinny tyres that are more designed for economy than performance and grip speaking of economy what kind of fuel consumption have i been getting for this week so on tripe in which i've done about 82 miles i've got 37 mpg not overly fantastic that is that is a mix of uh different driving for the trip b which was yesterday's driving which was mostly well again that's that's kind of combined as well come to think of it i got when it loads up 45.2 mpg not bad but nothing really amazing either is it for what it's designed for i.e being a city car the 500 is pretty good at its job it is easy to maneuver easy to park all the controls are light and it is a very good tool for navigating a city center the visibility is is good as well okay the the sea pillars are really thick but whilst i've had the car i've not had any issues with visibility and in case you do get a little bit stuck this trim level as standard does come with rear parking sensors so that is quite handy speaking of trim levels the fiat 500 hybrid is available in no less than seven yes seven trim levels they range from thirteen thousand seven hundred and five pounds all the way through to sixteen thousand nine hundred and thirty five pounds to keep things simple i'm going to cover just one trim level although that isn't as simple as it may seem after all that is because the car shown in this video is the lounge version which is obsolete it has since been replaced by the connect version which is a very similar specification the connect trim level is one up from the entry level pop version and starts from 15 435 pounds standard features include 15 inch alloys rear parking sensors sport body style 7 inch touchscreen with apple carplay and android auto cruise control air conditioning and front fog lights the car tested here does also have tomtom navigation but that is an optional extra the same can be said for the rather eye-catching epic blue paintwork which sadly isn't available as an option for the connect version there's not much in the way of safety equipment but you do get to seven airbags as standard having said that there's no autonomous emergency braking which seems almost unheard of in 2021 so the fiat 500 hybrid is a bit behind the times it will probably come as little surprise that back in 2017 euro end cap gave the 500 just 3 out of 5 stars it's not just the safety tech that is a little bit dated the same can be said for the interior as i mentioned at the top of the video this particular design has been around for what feels like donkey's years and it's really starting to show on the inside i know the 500 is all about harking back to its retro roots but there is a difference between retro and dated this car for me on the inside is dated fiat uk for a car that would be 10 years old this would probably feel a little not so cutting edge and the fiat 500 was the first car i ever tested on car obsession the first car i had for a week and that was five years ago the interior of that car compared to this car is almost identical and that's half a decade that has gone by that's quite a significant amount of time as i've stated in other reviews of fiat products the touchscreen is nice to look at but my word is it's sluggish it's almost as sluggish as this one literal engine you hit something you wait for it you wait for it you're waiting for it oh it's there hit something else you wait for it and the process continues it isn't the worst touchscreen i've ever used that accolade probably has to go to honda sorry honda but it's it's a long way away from being the best as an option this car's got the tomtom navigation which does work it does work well once you've got it set up because this car is a mild hybrid not a hybrid you are not fooling us fiat you do of course get regenerative braking so when you lift off the accelerator you get a battery icon to the right hand side of the speedo which which shows you that you are recuperating energy that would otherwise be lost on top of that by going to the trip computer you can actually see how much energy you have recuperated so once it catches up with me because it is a little bit slow to respond and it's got many different options there we go energy gain so i've gained 1.38 kilowatt hours oh good i think i'll be honest i'm not convinced by this car for me it feels like a desperate attempt for fiat to keep an ageing platform going it's fine guys the new 500 is here just turn off the life support this model has served its time just let it retire gracefully i don't understand why this has been kept going yes i know it's got a mild hybrid and it's more economical compared to previous fiat 500s but this is still an old car i know there's some of you watching that may not want an electric 500 but you still want a new 500 but i would urge you just go and go into the used car market because i don't think this is the best way to spend your money and i have to be honest i would like to say a massive thank you for fiat uk for loaning me this car for the weekend of course i thank you for you guys watching this video i do hope you have enjoyed it or found it useful or informative if so be sure to like comment and subscribe if you are subscribed don't forget to click the bell icon so you get notified every time i make a video but until the next time guys

Nothing new here.  Some here say that fuel cuts off when you are coasting in gear and that is true, but you are also losing momentum because of engine braking. The biggest net gain is to coast downhill in neutral.', 'I&#39;m a bit late to the party, but I have say for a short review, this is one of the best reviews on on here for the Fiat 500 Mild Hybrid.  Very informative to the point and more facts than opinion.   I can&#39;t have an electric Fiat due to living in an apartment, but this has helped me to make my mind up to upgrade my 2013 Fiat 500 Pop to the 500 Mild Hybrid.    Thank you.', 'Loving the hybrid. I have the Fiat 500x car tour on my channel', 'Seems to me this isn&#39;t really a hybrid like the Toyota Prius etc. which use an electric motor to drive the wheels. It&#39;s just a standard manual gearbox petrol engine car with a bit of KERS.', 'I‚Äôm confused about what you‚Äôve said about coasting‚Ä¶ is this something you‚Äôd do while going down a hill/slope? If yes, then it‚Äôs something most manual box drivers should already do, albeit maybe by simply holding in the clutch. There‚Äôs no benefit to being in gear at that point. You‚Äôre just wasting fuel. As your speed will change during your descent, you will then properly select your gear to match it when you‚Äôre ready to give it power again. It‚Äôs a big factor in attaining fuel economy with manual versus auto transmissions, which can‚Äôt truly disconnect the drivetrain from the wheels and let the engine idle while moving.', 'Its Honda Monkey among cars, by the way its weir that insurance for brand new Fiat 500 starts on 155¬£ but older models are presented on autotrader with price tax tag 30¬£. I would expect new car will have much less tax and insurance cost than older', 'I love that car. Ir&#39;s the perfect daily driver.', 'Thanks for your great review! I bought this model in 2021 and I agree with everything you mentioned. Mine is epic blue with a cream steering wheel &amp; all the options available for the series: chrome mirrors, tinted back windows, touch screen navigation board, seat height adjustment, etc. I‚Äôve had it for 6 months and I love it. It‚Äôs cheap to run and it‚Äôs very stylish and comfortable. As you rightly point out, it‚Äôs not terribly powerful so I‚Äôm always careful to have plenty of space to overtake. I do use the ‚Äúsailing‚Äù mode to avoid using up too much petrol and it‚Äôs a smart way of doing so although it will not keep up the speed unless the engine is restarted but it is helpful when stuck in traffic for ex. I like it', 'Great review great car loved my twin air Lounge.', 'Why neutral. Just depressing the clutch is coasting.', 'I miss the 105bhp 1L twinair', 'Lovely car I am considering for the 500ev', 'Love this review', 'Dissapointing that there&#39;s no rear camera', 'A good summary. I have the Star version hybrid and according to the hybrid readout it charges when you come off the accelerator but in gear.

I &#39;m  averaging over 60 mpg in all types of driving and its is necessary to use the gears to get good acceleration but at motorway speeds its fine and the engine is quiet with no wind noise but some from the tyres.', 'Just went looking for a Fiat 500 to buy for my daughter (new).  We found 3 (three !!) of these brandnew cars at the dealer with scratches on the dashboard, so indeed it looks nice but I&#39;m afraid these nice looks will disappear rather quickly. One of them also got scratches at the back of the rear seats - they are just slightly painted black, no descent protection whatever.  Although the budget is higher we&#39;ll probably get a Mini...', 'I got a  hybrid dolce vita  Full option  and  I adore it  amazing  car', 'THEY SHOULD TRIPLE GLAZE ALL. THE WINDOWS. TO IMPROVE.

SOONER THAN LATER', 'How much would you say you save In petrol costs? I have just brought one :?', 'Daughter just purchased one of these today and I like it. Perfect for a young person that needs to get from A to B. I was surprised with how tidy it was inside. Hopefully she can have a few years of troublesome driving. If I was in me teenage years or early twenties and female I would pick one up too! Good review. Thanks', 'Coasting is also keeping the clutch down unnecessary.', 'Sit', 'I absolutely do ,  for city driving, thats what the car is made for. (N ) I have noticed a huge difference in petrol consumption, for the better.The sensors are great as it shows on the digital dash with the sound how close when reversing, makes up for the small window and helpful. I love my fiat. Its a great car and my 3rd over the years.  They have come on a long way. Fiats get so much negativety. Try one 1st.  Then have an opinion. Its not everyone&#39;s cup of tea but it is mine. Great video. Refreshing', 'Nice review. Thanks. Thinking about buying one of this...', 'Please come and watch my Fiat 500 channel.

But I do like my reversing camera.', 'Great vid as always Tish. I think it&#39;s a nice looking car but I&#39;m really not sure about the coasting.

It&#39;s a car you don&#39;t buy for speed but for the piece of Italy you can carry with you. The dolcevita üòä.  It&#39;s one of the very last city cars on the market. Cars don&#39;t stop getting bigger (which is actually an absolute nonsense for the planet). Fiat 500 isn&#39;t perfect but it has much charm. While all of the other cars have dark and sad interiors, fiat 500 is bright and joyful. It gives smile when you drive it.

I think it&#39;s not available in the UK for the moment.', 'Thanks for a good review. I too have reservations around the concept of coasting, especially rolling along in Neutral. When I was learning to drive, many years ago, this was considered a no no because technically, as I understood it, you would not have full control of the vehicle. However, you point out that this is now considered ok, but I for one would find coasting awkward so wouldn&#39;t be using that feature. Am I alone in my thinking?', 'omg hi tishhh üëãüèæüòç', 'Great review, Tish :)<br><br>13 years is an impressive run with little changes made. Despite its size, it still stands out. <br><br>I have looked at images of the new forthcoming 500, and, for me, the interior looks like it might be a bit of a let down style-wise. It won&#39;t have that retro look that the current interior has.<br><br>I don&#39;t have too many complaints about the dash design, as is, and the screen doesn&#39;t look too much like an afterthought.

Shortening of critical and Latin for wanker. This is cool, cheap, fun, and hybrid just makes it even better for certain types of commuters.

you're just finding my channel and you like new car reviews then please go ahead and hit the subscribe button i'd love to have you join me on my journey today i'm going to be reviewing the brand new fiat 500 and this is actually fiat's new hybrid model since 2007 the fiat 500 has become an absolute staple on our roads there's been a few rivals come and go but the fiat 500 has remained pretty similar looking throughout the years and i believe that is a completely safe option for a lot of people now if you do a quick google search it doesn't take long to realize that critics don't really rave about the fiat 500 i think fiat feel that they get away with a lot by this being such a popular model but then again not many cars come close to it for its small quirky styles and there's only such rivals as the mini which is more expensive to buy and more expensive to run and then there was the vauxhall adam and also the citroen ds3 but both of those cars are now discontinued so if you want something that looks fun stylish is cheap to run then you can't really go wrong with the fiat so as i mentioned previously in 10 years the fiat 500 hasn't had many changes it's still got its small and compact size which is brilliant for driving around cities plus it has city steering so that means that it makes it light and agile there are some negatives to the fiat 500 in the fact that some people think that its build quality is slightly lesser than other brands but all in all it remains a very strong option this model that i have in particular is actually the lounge model so this new lineup of cars gets a few different options the entry level pop gets 14 inch steel wheels air con daytime running lights and a speed limiter which is a good level of specification comparing it to previous models the lounge which is the one i'm testing today gets 15 inch alloys apple carplay and android auto fog lights and rear parking sensors the sport does what it says on the tin and adds some sporty styling like a rear spoiler and tinted windows it loses the sunroof but gains cruise control the star gets bigger 16-inch alloys a digital instrument cluster and an automatic climate control while rockstar similar to the sport gets all the specification of the star but with sportier styling including tinted windows and a different style of alloy wheel the car i'm testing today seems to be the best value for money and will remain the most popular trim i was really pleasantly surprised with the interior of this fiat 500 of course i never know which ones i'm going to get and all of the cars i'd looked at online all had the recycled seats now although i love the idea of helping the environment with the recycled materials they are super dull looking and these checkered seats with the black and gray stitching and the white piping are a lot lot nicer plus it does make me feel a lot better that although i've got a leather wrapped steering wheel this isn't real leather it all ties in really nicely with the exterior of the car and the really nice gray gloss dash the dashboard is logically laid out and features lots of glossy plastic buttons which gives the 500 a classy feel however the gloss finish can show up scratches easy if you're not careful and the light dashboard colours can be reflected in the windows when the sun is low it's also starting to feel somewhat dated which is all the more noticeable in this latest model the steering wheel is thinner than the old models and has flashes of chrome and higher quality materials before too space in the fit 500 probably isn't going to be number one of your priorities but it is still going to be important so i'm going to go ahead and get in the back and see how i get on like you can expect it's not class leading but there is a comfortable amount of space here for short journeys and smaller people it shouldn't be a problem there is a little bit of a letdown that there's no usb chargers in the back to keep kids occupied but there is access to two of these cup holders and there are isofix fitments for two child seats in the rear this car is the lounge spec which gets rear parking sensors as standard now the only thing i would say about these rear parking sensors is there's no visual aid it is only the sound which it's nice to have them especially considering that's quite a small rear window so seeing out of it can be difficult but it's just a shame that there's no visual parking display the all-new hybrid fiat 500 gets a one liter three cylinder petrol engine but it also gets a 3.6 kilowatt starter meter so what the starter meter does is it takes the energy lost from your braking and your coasting and then it runs it through a lithium-ion battery and then uses that energy to help the car run a little bit faster and also help it start up from the start stop and give you better economy now one thing you will have noticed i just said then was breaking which is completely common but coasting now coasting is a bit of a strange one and i actually had to check that it's okay nowadays to coast cars which it is and i was completely unaware of if you don't know what coasting is you've probably never run your car down to zero miles and desperately tried to get to the petrol station so coasting is when you take it out of all gears put it in neutral and let the car essentially roll along now that's something that the fiat 500 wants you to do so it will come up on the front dash and it will say n and at that point it wants you to put the car in neutral and to roll along i don't know if this is a little bit naughty from fiat because to include that in the official mpg figures probably not a lot of fiat 500 owners are gonna know to use the car in neutral so i don't know let me know below do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing that they're using neutral in their figures the hybrid engine doesn't particularly feel that much different to the standard petrol car either because it's so well integrated or because it's not really doing that much at all driven blind it's unlikely you'd notice any difference between this and the 1.2 litre petrol engine that it technically replaces fiat claims the new motor is between 10 20 to 30 more efficient wltp figures claim fuel economy of around 53.3 miles per gallon this little fear gets a modest 70 brake horsepower now if 70 brake horsepower means absolutely nothing to you then it isn't the quickest it will get from naught to 60 in 14 seconds which has shaved off just a few milliseconds than the previous time however for everyday driving can this car cope and absolutely it can i drive a car like this every single day and if you just want it to get from a to b then it is plenty quick enough if you want something that is going to put a smile on your face from how much is fun it is to drive and you also want something that you can comfortably take over people on back roads then this probably isn't going to be one for you but if you're not a speed demon and you just want something that is going to get you from a to b quite comfortably then yes it's absolutely fine as with all of the cars that i test drive i have done extensive research before i drove the fitter 500 and sometimes it's difficult to not let that research cloud your judgment and actually that's easier said than done because i did go into this test drive expecting to hate the fiat 500 and struggle to find things that i like about it i've actually been pleasantly surprised remember that i am directly comparing this to my car which is the volkswagen up which has 75 brake horsepower so around five more brake horsepower and actually this car doesn't feel any more slower it does go slightly quicker through the gears because it's got six gears so you do feel like you're changing gear quite often but other than that one thing that's really surprised me is the steering is really weighted and this level wrapped steering wheel is really soft and feels quite luxurious so the drive is actually quite enjoyable yes it does take a little bit of a push to get it up to speed but so is any small engine city car if you've brought this car because you want to get a great mile per gallon then i think you can be reasonably impressed with it notably the fiat 500 is quite a noisy drive and i think really that's the only thing that's spoiling the experience of this car although if you had the stereo on it would probably drown this out i mean how many times especially for 500 drivers do you drive in complete silence i don't think it's enough to put me off of this car but it is something to take into consideration there is a reasonable amount of safety equipment fitted as standard all models come with a skid reducing anti-lock brakes seven airbags and electronic stability management as well as hill hold assist and hydraulic brake assistance to help with emergency stop but is certainly once again behind other brands that have the anti-collision technology and lane assist thank you so much for taking the time to watch this video if you've enjoyed it then please give it a massive thumbs up and get involved in the comments below do you still think that this is a good rival for the city car market or do you think that fear need to have a big change thank you to my sister nicole for lending me her fiat 500 for the day and until next time bye [Music] you

new fiat 500 hybrid and today i will review it i will show you the interior exterior i try to go in every single detail inside and give you the price and all that kind of information if you're new on my channel please click the subscribe button uh to see all the new updates and all the new videos that come on the channel uh also um yeah let's get to the to the work guys so first of all guys we will start with the key this is the key it's a pretty light key it stays very well in the pocket so uh also it comes classic it doesn't have a start engine button just keep in mind i will show you also when we go in the interior also you have this trunk button that you can lock and unlock the trunk from here of course it doesn't have an automatic liftgate but you can do that from the key without any problem so uh before we go forward uh let me put the key here inside the car all right it's just a classic system and let me give you the price and all the information about the car so we have here the new fiat 500 with one liter uh engine petrol engine and 70 horsepower uh hybrid star so fiat 500 hybrid star i guess this is the the version name then going forward you can see the the color on the exterior on the interior i will show you in the moment also the car come with a free cylinder 70 or 70 horsepower and a manual gearbox with six uh six gear shifter the fact that it comes with this six gear shifter it's amazing for the consumption guys this car have also under the seat here on a battery so um this this is helping the the mild uh system to economize but i will talk about that a little bit later uh also guys let me go forward here you can see all the options that come on this car the the base is the basis price of the car it's 20 000 francs around 90 000 then you add to the car some package in some options you can see the price here you can see the option in the packages right here uh and the price will be 22 500 but guys this car have a great discount and you can buy this car with 80 900 francs around 80 000 dollars only if you come at belvag auto this is in burn the center is in burn you can check them out also on the internet at belvag punkt see hush there you can find all the uh information about the car and about the price and stuff like that now that we are finished with that let me show you also the car it's uh it has 1127 kilograms uh the consumption is around six liter in the city most of this consumption this is the the average consumption also on the highway and you know why it's so high because usually you will get around four or five liter but this consumption taking the consideration that you go on the highway when you drive on the highway with the car will be a little bit more complicated because there with free cylinders at high speed the consumption will be higher then you can see that it's in efficience class a and this is amazing i mean it's it's great anyway let's go forward so as i said before the car come with the high with the uh battery that is under the seats here that help the system it's a mild hybrid system 12 volt battery uh and it's a small battery but it's enough to help the the engine uh for a better consumption now let's go to the exterior of the car and i want to go to the exterior i want to show you around the car a little bit and then we will start with the important stuffs i like very much also the rims that comes on this model on this version i think it fits very very well with the car those rims are just perfect for the car also the color is quite nice in the front the front of the car it's quite classic for a fiat 500 but i like it very much i like the chrome i like the the round lights it's quite nice cute car for the city i mean it's it's just super nice and also the fact that it's small you can park it almost everywhere because it's small and it's easy to drive and we will go inside and i will show you also my favorite parts on the car now going forward first time i want to show you the lights let me turn on the lights and i just want to show you the lights guys with the contact then turn on the also you can see it has a nice graphic here and here it's amazing but i will show you that when i will go inside the car now check out the lights let me close also the trunk because i opened it up uh earlier now guys you can see here the car come with uh this is those are the the turning signals the turning signals are not led light and also even uh the taillights no leds just have a normal bolt light there uh but the design is quite nice so you can see it also from from the back here the design is nice i wish they were led but i guess it's still okay now let's go in the front to show you the other lights usually uh most of the car have here the turning signal light but uh fiat choice to put it here on the body of the car on the panel and also this one is not an led light it's just a normal bulb light that's something to keep in mind again and then going forward here guys also we have the turning signals up there normal boat lights right here and here we have the cenon lights no led just stand on but cenon it's more than enough for you in the night to to see to have a great visibility and also you have here the fog lamps uh down here that are normal bolt light you can see close up there uh normal bulb light and you have more than enough light in the night uh to see and if i go a lit but if i'm not wrong i think this is the those are the fog lamps down here and this is kind of the the lobin or the high bin i'm not sure about that really right me guys i'm really curious anyway here are the fog lamps and and i don't know why they have this shape i'm not sure if they are led lights anyway write me guys if you know but anyway i like the front of the car the bumper look nice also the chrome design down here i think it looks really good also the way they design it in the front uh those little points here remember me a little bit of mercedes guys i don't know if you know the grills the new grills from mercedes and it looks quite good uh the lines here in the front other than that fiat logo in the middle chrome design pretty simple also i like these two lines right here make the car look much more sporty much more interesting and aggressive also the car doesn't come with parking sensors in the front on this price i think you can get it as an option but in this price you will don't get uh the parking sensors also the daylight by the way the daylight it's led and it's around those edges here so the daylight i think you can see it if you go closer this is the daylight and they look nice the daylight look really really nice really modern really fancy in my opinion this is the front of the car also by the way guys i want to show you something here the car come also with the raining sensor uh that it's right there for the wipers so that's again something extra and nice the wipers are quite big that that's something that i want to show you the wipers are big and nice and they they clean really well the the the windscreen i i tested before and they they are gorgeous um like i see before let me go on this side it's more light you can see it better i like the shape of the mirror are quite nice round uh and nice here we have some matte plastic down here going on this side i drive the car and i like very much the mirrors they are big you have a great visibility on the mirrors and that's that's something that i like very much from the interior but i will talk about that when i will go in the interior also the rims one of my favorite parts on those car uh the car come with goodyear tires the rims 500 logo in the middle the rims look super super nice um and you can see inside there it comes with ventilated brake discs that's awesome and they're quite big to be honest i see cars with more horsepower with smaller brake discs but those are quite impressive i mean i'm really impressed also 16-inch rims you can see down there and they look super nice on the car guys i mean look at this i don't know if you can see it so well but they look really impressive now on the back the car come doesn't come with the brake discs the car come with the drums uh we see on many many cars uh even on the volkswagen id3 the full electric come with the drums in the back so that's that's kind of normal because the car the brake most of the time in the front in the front have amazing brake discs i drive the car and i didn't feel like it has drums i mean it feels really good when he break now around the edges of the windows here we have some rubber normal on this upper side and here we have some chrome design it's quite fancy this chrome and i think it looks really good the windows are big and you will see when we go inside that you have very good visibility also the handles pretty normal uh chrome design nothing fancy to the handles it's it's just uh the way it should be also it has a line on the side that make it interesting other than that the design of the car it's very similar with the normal uh fiat 500 now here on the right side you have the tank so you can fuel with gas

It&#39;s a beautiful looking little car! I love it. A few tricks I found out gradually that&#39;s quite nifty: you can slide all the vent handles up and down - not just the usual swing with the vents but the handles all move up &amp; down! it&#39;s really cool to clip a mobile phone holder for navigation &amp; carplay connect. 2nd nifty trick good to know about: when one of the doors/boot isn&#39;t closed properly, when you press the key beep, the car flashes the signals in a way to make you aware of that anomaly. 3rd nifty trick, if you want to central lock all the doors when inside (ie. when driving through an unsafe area), it&#39;s possible by pressing down the door handle on the driver&#39;s side - it looks both doors at the same time this way. Another cool trick it has is that when you come home at night and there&#39;s no light to see the keyhole of the gates, you can stop the car and push down the lights knob a few times and it goes into &quot;follow me home&quot; mode. The more you press it down the longer the lights will stay on after the ignition&#39;s off, with max time of 210 seconds. It&#39;s all cool tricks to know about.', 'I am going 500 hybrid shopping in January and unless I can sell my 10 year old messy son, I shall not be going for a car with cream seats.

Premetto alcune considerazioni: prendo fiat 500 con la formula Sempre Nuova, quindi un noleggio a lungo termine. Questa √® la mia terza 500 in 4 anni. Sempre allestimento Sport e le prime due con motorizzazione 1200 69 cv. Quindi posso fare un paragone sui consumi e tutto il resto. Uso l‚Äôauto principalmente per andare a lavoro effettuando due tragitti al giorno di 6 km quindi un totale giornaliero di 12 km utilizzando una seconda auto per spostamenti medio lunghi, viaggi, trasporti ed ingombri vari. L‚Äô ho presa perch√© volevo provare questo nuovo motore a parit√† di allestimento con le vetture passate, mi costava 1000eurini in meno e doveva darmi circa 4 km in pi√π con un litro. Perch√© no! mi sono detto, tanto  devo cambiarla‚Ä¶proviamo!!!Ebbene  parliamo adesso della la 500 ibrida :<br>sto terminando il mio primo pieno, sono ad oggi a 360 km . I consumi sono identici al 1200. Certo sono ancora al primo pieno ma sono molto deluso. Il problema √® il sistema elettrico BSG (Belt integrated Starter Generator) da 12 volt applicato direttamente sul motore che consente di recuperare energia in fase di frenata e decelerazione e stivarla in una batteria al litio da 11 Ah: funziona quando vuole lui!!!! Mi spiego meglio:<br>esco al mattino alle <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmxvc1UBT8&amp;t=510"">08:30</a> con meno 4 gradi e si avvia il tutto, quindi start &amp; stop attivo, Il sistema permette di recuperare energia in frenata o decelerazione e il motore termico si spegne anche in marcia, al di sotto dei 30 km/h.<br>Esco dall‚Äôufficio alle 18 con 3 o 4 gradi di temperatura e non si attiva nulla, solo il motore termico. Faccio notare le temperature esterne perch√® pensavo fosse quello  il motivo della mancanza di attivazione dello start &amp; stop  ma non influisce. Ho escluso cintura di sicurezza non agganciata e/o batteria scarica. A volte non si attiva. A volte spegnendo il motore al semaforo, togliendo la chiave dal quadro e ripartendo si attiva. A volte durante la marcia si disattiva ma mai fino adesso √® avvenuto il contrario, attivarsi dopo un‚Äô accensione senza start &amp; stop.<br>Alcune note positive della vettura:<br>il cambio a sei marce √® veramente piacevole e si avverte subito quanto comunicato dalla casa costruttrice la quale dichiara nuovi cuscinetti e guarnizioni a basso attrito ed utilizzo di  uno specifico lubrificante ad alta efficienza .Ho notato la  tenuta di strada e la stabilit√† pi√π precisa forse come dicono,  per via del motore che √® stato abbassato di 45 millimetri con il baricentro pi√π basso.<br>Ripeto, sono pochi km, pur essendo un mese di utilizzo, ma se devi fondare tutto l‚Äôibrido sul sistema elettrico BSG e questo si attiva quando vuole, sarai sempre e solo col motore termico alle partenze, senza start &amp; stop e quindi i consumi e la questione ambiente va a farsi benedire. A me non cambia niente dal punto di vista pratico, questa 500 o la 1.2 , una vale l‚Äôaltra ma se devo consigliarla sulla base della mia esperienza attuale, ho seri dubbi sui consumi dichiarati che secondo la Casa, dovrebbe garantire  consumi ed emissioni ridotti dal 20% al 30%......<br>Non penso di portarla in officina per un controllo, conoscendoli so gi√† le risposte‚Ä¶.Vedr√≤ nei prossimi mesi come si comporter√†‚Ä¶..<br><br>Aggiornamento del 14 Maggio 2021:\xa0<br>dopo circa 2100 km il sistema ibrido sembra funzionare perfettamente.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snh02LPya_A,IGNITION,2021-09-16T13:24:51Z,2575,[],[],[Music] well today is really exciting for the fiat brand but particularly for us is the cinco chanter series nine launch within the south african market the series nine for us is is really great in that it encompasses a trim line for every single customer that's out there it has enhanced features both from a spec level and as you go through and immerse through the trim line we're trying to engage our customer base trying to allow the motor vehicle as an expression of their personality on the outside refreshing an icon like the fiat 500 has to be a daunting task for any automotive designer continued commercial success necessitates constant improvement but change it too drastically and you might be accused of sacrilege fiat has opted for a conservative approach for the latest round of upgrades introducing a new range of body colors like a rancho sicilia orange and cloud grey as well as contemporary cabin materials and finishes high-end models also boast specific side skirts bumpers a rear spoiler and discreet chrome badging the entry trim level is on cult a step up from the cult you'll get the connect then we have a sport and a dolce chivita [Music] my first experience with the fiat 500 we were filming um i was on the other side of the camera and yeah it was quite a cool little thing back then and here we are again five six years later that's right cuckoo we sampled the twin air power plant when it made its local debut back in 2016 and morris and i were blown away by the punch served up by the little 900cc2 pot but does it still hold its own five years down the road a much more improved driving quality from the last time i drove this car i think the first thing surprised me was the engine you know i didn't expect much in the way of power experiencing a two-cylinder car you'd expect it to be a little sluggish and slow but it goes it really does go it's really got a nice rough rumbly sort of engine note which is cute in a small little car like this [Music] the 500 has always been about personalization you know so you can project your own personality in there for me it's uh the dolce vita dolce vita dolce vita it's a free spirited car a white dash white steering wheel white indicators which is great for a gangster like me normally go for the base model you know but these ones here and that's often because it's got sort of simplest that most economical engine but also in a way that represents the ssh essence yeah they've all got the same engine system at a spec and we drove the pulse i like that i think it's i like the wheel design on that car it's not overly fancy inside well there's clearly a perfect model for every individual but i'm sure all you vault heads out there are wondering if the electric model is coming to sa what i would tell you at this point in time is that there's no opportunity that's been left off the table so watch the space [Music]

La mia Toyota yaris ibrida ha il cambio automatico', 'Ciao a tutti. Sono in possesso di una 5oo ibrida Sport dal 16 Dicembre 2020. Premetto alcune considerazioni: prendo fiat 500 con la formula Sempre Nuova, quindi un noleggio a lungo termine. Questa √® la mia terza 500 in 4 anni. Sempre allestimento Sport e le prime due con motorizzazione 1200 69 cv. Quindi posso fare un paragone sui consumi e tutto il resto. Uso l‚Äôauto principalmente per andare a lavoro effettuando due tragitti al giorno di 6 km quindi un totale giornaliero di 12 km utilizzando una seconda auto per spostamenti medio lunghi, viaggi, trasporti ed ingombri vari. L‚Äô ho presa perch√© volevo provare questo nuovo motore a parit√† di allestimento con le vetture passate, mi costava 1000eurini in meno e doveva darmi circa 4 km in pi√π con un litro. Perch√© no! mi sono detto, tanto  devo cambiarla‚Ä¶proviamo!!!Ebbene  parliamo adesso della la 500 ibrida :<br>sto terminando il mio primo pieno, sono ad oggi a 360 km . I consumi sono identici al 1200. Certo sono ancora al primo pieno ma sono molto deluso. Il problema √® il sistema elettrico BSG (Belt integrated Starter Generator) da 12 volt applicato direttamente sul motore che consente di recuperare energia in fase di frenata e decelerazione e stivarla in una batteria al litio da 11 Ah: funziona quando vuole lui!!!! Mi spiego meglio:<br>esco al mattino alle <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmxvc1UBT8&amp;t=510"">08:30</a> con meno 4 gradi e si avvia il tutto, quindi start &amp; stop attivo, Il sistema permette di recuperare energia in frenata o decelerazione e il motore termico si spegne anche in marcia, al di sotto dei 30 km/h.<br>Esco dall‚Äôufficio alle 18 con 3 o 4 gradi di temperatura e non si attiva nulla, solo il motore termico. Faccio notare le temperature esterne perch√® pensavo fosse quello  il motivo della mancanza di attivazione dello start &amp; stop  ma non influisce. Ho escluso cintura di sicurezza non agganciata e/o batteria scarica. A volte non si attiva. A volte spegnendo il motore al semaforo, togliendo la chiave dal quadro e ripartendo si attiva. A volte durante la marcia si disattiva ma mai fino adesso √® avvenuto il contrario, attivarsi dopo un‚Äô accensione senza start &amp; stop.<br>Alcune note positive della vettura:<br>il cambio a sei marce √® veramente piacevole e si avverte subito quanto comunicato dalla casa costruttrice la quale dichiara nuovi cuscinetti e guarnizioni a basso attrito ed utilizzo di  uno specifico lubrificante ad alta efficienza .Ho notato la  tenuta di strada e la stabilit√† pi√π precisa forse come dicono,  per via del motore che √® stato abbassato di 45 millimetri con il baricentro pi√π basso.<br>Ripeto, sono pochi km, pur essendo un mese di utilizzo, ma se devi fondare tutto l‚Äôibrido sul sistema elettrico BSG e questo si attiva quando vuole, sarai sempre e solo col motore termico alle partenze, senza start &amp; stop e quindi i consumi e la questione ambiente va a farsi benedire. A me non cambia niente dal punto di vista pratico, questa 500 o la 1.2 , una vale l‚Äôaltra ma se devo consigliarla sulla base della mia esperienza attuale, ho seri dubbi sui consumi dichiarati che secondo la Casa, dovrebbe garantire  consumi ed emissioni ridotti dal 20% al 30%......<br>Non penso di portarla in officina per un controllo, conoscendoli so gi√† le risposte‚Ä¶.Vedr√≤ nei prossimi mesi come si comporter√†‚Ä¶..<br><br>Aggiornamento del 14 Maggio 2021:\xa0<br>dopo circa 2100 km il sistema ibrido sembra funzionare perfettamente.

On Sardinia we had the regular non hybrid version and in Portugal the 500e. The last one not a real pleasant car to drive in my opinion. Maybe in cities itself or more flat countries als the Netherlands where I&#39;m from but we didn&#39;t find it pleasant to drive. The clutch smells burned really really quick if you have some short stop/up-hill/stops etc. Also warning lights with the stop/start system. The regular petrol 500 drives more smooth. Rental car companies better invest in the new 500 full EV besides petrol 500&#39;s.', 'You managed to get through the whole review without a mention of one manger fact that should always be included in any review.

It&#39;s not an hybrid. It&#39;s just an enhanced Start&amp;stop system.

It&#39;s perfect for the city. That&#39;s sure that the for the same amount of money you can easily find a better car but you can&#39;t find a car with such a charm.', 'Good review!

Ich hatte den als Mietauto in Gr und bin viele Km gefahren ohne Probleme. Der Berichterstatter ist gro√ü und breit, f√§hrt Privat vermutlich einen Fetten Wagen und ist verw√∂hnt. Der Fiat ist ein Puristisches Auto und vom der Sch√∂nheit kommt h√∂chstens Citro√´n nach . Die meisten , auf den US Markt angestimmten Autos sind nur noch h√§sslich und protzig', 'Wie gro√ü ist der Kollege denn? Ist der fiat was f√ºr Leute √ºber 190cm wenn die Sitze in der H√∂he nicht verstellbar sind?', 'Wir haben den 500 Sport Hybrid.(Als Zweitwagen) Ein sehr handliches und schickes Auto f√ºr die Kurzstrecke. Und da ist der Hybrid tats√§chlich sehr sparsam im Verbrauch. Nach 5000 Km im Mittelgebirge Sommer und Winter kann ich sagen, der kleine ist Klasse und macht Spa√ü. Es ist sicher kein Rennwagen, aber im Ort und √úberlandverkehr kommen wir nie √ºber 5 Liter auf 100 KM. Autobahn macht keinen Spa√ü, da ist der Verbrauch beim kleinen Saugbenziner auch locker bei 7L. Auch braucht man da keinen Mildhybrid. Bei viel Kurzstrecke im Winter muss die Starterbatterie ab und zu mit Ladeger√§t nachgeladen werden, damit die Rekuperation zuverl√§ssig funktioniert. Wer viel im dunklen f√§hrt sollte sich Xenonlicht g√∂nnen. Der 500er ist auf jeden Fall viel Alltagstauglicher und vermutlich haltbarer und wertstabiler als der Dacia Spring oder VW E up, die wir beide auch getestet haben.', 'Ich habe seit 2 Jahren den Fiat 500 hey Google und bin total zufrieden ... 5 Liter auf 100 und 200 km kann man prima am St√ºck fahren. Auf die vorderen Sitze mache ich immer und bisher bei jedem Auto, das ich hatte, echte Lammfellbez√ºge darauf - im Sommer schwitzt man nicht und klebt nicht an den Sitzen fest und im Winter spart man sich eine Sitzheizung. Perfektes knuffiges Auto, das auch wenig Unterhalt kostet.', 'Hatte dem 500er als Mietwagen in Spanien. Drei Erwachsene haben absolut ausreichend viel Platz. Es handelte sich um einen Hybrid, unter dem Fahrersitz befand sich eine Box, die den Fu√üraum einschr√§nkt. Unter dem Beifahrersitz jedoch ist extrem viel Raum f√ºr die F√º√üe, dass man die Beine fast gerade ausstrecken kann! Unglaublich! Tolles Auto! F√ºr die Stadt echt cool, auch f√ºr mittlere Distanzen prima.', 'Das sind Radkappen?! <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/DfgfY9LaNdmMq7IPuI2AaA""></a>', 'Sehr cooles Video!

is the video that i've been most excited for¬†¬† um over the past week or so so i got a new car¬†
um you might be able to tell but it's a fiat 500¬†¬† so i will insert the b-roll after this that i¬†
took of the car um just to show you like the¬†¬† inside and everything before we get into the tour¬†
but i absolutely love it um it's the cutest car¬†¬† i've ever owned it's got quite a few add-ons¬†
so it's really nice to drive and it's also¬†¬† very comfortable in terms of like the screen¬†
system and all of that which we will get into¬†¬† um but i definitely love it and¬†
it's an upgrade from my old car¬†¬† which i sold last night¬†
after a month of it being on¬†¬† various websites to sell so um it's really nice¬†
to be able to go and just drive this one and not¬†¬† have to worry about the other one because i was¬†
getting a bit worried that no one would buy it so¬†¬† um we're gonna get right into the tour um i will¬†
be showing you all of the inside all of the spec¬†¬† um going into all of the features that it has i¬†
will be doing a very brief video under the bonnet¬†¬† just because i don't know anything about cars so¬†
i'm really sorry but um i don't know what people¬†¬† want me to show them but i definitely know that¬†
when i did my peugeot one people just asked to see¬†¬† under the bonnet so that's what i'm gonna do um i¬†
don't know what you want to see in specific but um¬†¬† it means that hopefully you'll get a bit of an¬†
idea of what's under there and like the order of¬†¬† it all etc um but like i say i don't know anything¬†
about cars so i don't know what to show you¬†¬† exactly um but i just wanted to show you around¬†
my new car so i hope you enjoy um it's different¬†¬† to my usual baking content but i hope you¬†
still enjoy it and let's get right into it so this is the outside it's a black fiat¬†
500 lounge so i'm just going to take you¬†¬† inside to show you the interior we'll go more in¬†
depth in this in a minute but as you can see it's¬†¬† got the checkered seats which i absolutely love¬†
and then the cream leather which again is lovely¬†¬† then we have all the cream interior we've got a¬†
screen which i'll go into it's the more advanced¬†¬† one than the standard model so we have quite a¬†
few more features and then we got the black dash¬†¬† which again is so lovely fiat 500 logo and then¬†
you've got the door pockets either side and the¬†¬† windows are here which always throws me off but¬†
it is actually really good because then you're¬†¬† not leaning to one side to do the windows you can¬†
do it from the central station and it also means¬†¬† if you want to close the opposite side then¬†
you can because otherwise it would normally¬†¬† be on the other door so that is the dash area and¬†
then we have the back seat so it is a four seater¬†¬† as you can see they're really nice big seats i¬†
think that there's so much room in there they're¬†¬† actually the same size i don't know if you can¬†
tell but they're the same size as the front seat¬†¬† so by taking out that middle seat it allows¬†
you to have bigger back seats which i think¬†¬† is great um it is auto which again we'll get into¬†
because it's actually semi-auto um so we've got¬†¬† that stick there and then you've got a usb aux¬†
i've got some air fresheners this is my black¬†¬† box so it plugs in here and then it actually goes¬†
under the chair but that's just where it plugs in¬†¬† so this is the inside and we're going to get right¬†
into all of the spec and everything in a minute so¬†¬† this is the boot as you can see you can fit quite¬†
a lot in here i've just got my reusable bags¬†¬† and then this is a little seat for cleo it's¬†
like kind of like a fold out basket that goes¬†¬† on the front seat there and then i've just¬†
got a towel for her but as you can see it fits¬†¬† quite a lot in it you can probably have¬†
about four shopping bags and then you can¬†¬† fit above that as well because as you can see¬†
there's a bit of room so you can probably i'm¬†¬† going to be using it when we go to weimar¬†
for the weekend so they'll have three very¬†¬† small cases so it should all fit in here and then¬†
this can be moved if you needed a bit more room¬†¬† so as you can see there's the back seat space¬†
there are cup holders there that is the handbrake¬†¬† and then we've got the central area in the front¬†
these are little bag hooks um so you can just¬†¬† people can hook their bags up on there in the¬†
back which is handy i bought those off ebay¬†¬† they were like three pounds so i just got those¬†
for people to hang stuff on because you have got¬†¬† slightly less room in the back that is just the¬†
breakdown kit it's got um various things in it¬†¬† that i don't even know about but um it got given¬†
with the car so that's just a little breakdown kit¬†¬† but yeah we're gonna go inside now so we're now¬†
inside in the passenger seat so i'm just gonna¬†¬† show you a few things about how the car actually¬†
works so it is key operated i don't know if i can¬†¬† show you there you go so it is an um keyless¬†
entry so you just turn it once so we don't¬†¬† get a copyright um so you just turn it once for¬†
everything to come on and it always says this if¬†¬† anyone knows how to get rid of this it always says¬†
it and you just always leave it and it goes away¬†¬† um and then to actually turn it on¬†
foot on the break because it's a auto and then it turns on like so so i have the¬†
more advanced screen i will try and show you¬†¬† a image um maybe like here um of the comparison¬†
of the standard screen and this one because it's¬†¬† definitely a lot more advanced so imagine a¬†
older car it would usually have not touched¬†¬† touchscreen it'll all be buttons down the bottom¬†
which i definitely didn't like my old car had¬†¬† a screen very similar to this where it was all¬†
touch screen it wasn't as advanced as this this¬†¬† definitely has a lot more options which we love¬†
um but yeah i definitely wanted the touchscreen¬†¬† elements with all of the kind of like add-ons¬†
i guess um it definitely isn't standard so if¬†¬† you're looking for a fee at 500 you're gonna¬†
have to look quite far because i looked at¬†¬† quite a few before i found this one so we've got¬†
radio then you've got media which is your mobile¬†¬† then you have nav which again i love um it's¬†
tomtom um is the kind of like system that it uses¬†¬† so it's a bit more advanced than my last car um¬†
for those of you wondering who haven't watched the¬†¬† tour i had a peugeot 208 and it was the law so it¬†
had navigation in it as standard however it would¬†¬† always say that the zone wasn't mapped whereas¬†
i have used this to get back from saint albans¬†¬† and it definitely works so um yeah i'm really¬†
looking forward to using that when we go to¬†¬† weymouth because it'll be really really handy my¬†
last one it used to occasionally um restart so the¬†¬† screen would just restart which obviously when¬†
you're using a navigation that's not good so it¬†¬† wasn't very handy then we have uconnect which is¬†
how you actually connect your mobile and it's also¬†¬† got all of the settings then we have iphone which¬†
is how you pair so you can pair your iphone here¬†¬† and see all your contacts phone then uconnect is¬†
how you kind of use your phone if that makes sense¬†¬† um i'm still kind of working my way around¬†
it and then if you go to settings you've got¬†¬† more details there and then you can just scroll¬†
down here but like i said it's all touch screen¬†¬† and then there's also trips so then you can look¬†
at your consumption um your mile per gallon you¬†¬† can log trips like so so you can if you know say¬†
it's like a work trip then you can log it and then¬†¬† you'll know how much petrol and how many miles and¬†
time etc it takes you to get to that place i don't¬†¬† usually really use that so we will see if i end¬†
up making any use of it but again the navigation¬†¬† system is not standard the person that owned this¬†
car decided to put all the add-ons on it so it¬†¬† meant that when i bought it it had everything it¬†
also has a dash cam which is not standard these¬†¬† are about 200 pounds so they didn't take that when¬†
they sold it to me luckily but again like i say¬†¬† that is an add-on um i would definitely recommend¬†
it because obviously if anyone crashes into you¬†¬† um or like say you crashing someone else it's just¬†
a log the reason it's good to have it on the front¬†¬† is because it's typically common um it's more so¬†
to fight your side that it's typically common that¬†¬† um if you were to say you were overtaking someone¬†
and they pulled out on you and you damaged the¬†¬† back corner of their car they would automatically¬†
assume as an insurer that you went into the back¬†¬† of them when obviously the dash cam would show¬†
that they pulled out on you something like that¬†¬† it's obviously handy to have it on the back as¬†
well but i only currently have it on the front¬†¬† so it's more so that if i was um to crash into¬†
someone and it wasn't my fault then it means¬†¬† i could prove it it doesn't cover me if someone¬†
crashes in the back of me because it's not on the¬†¬† back but that's something that i'm looking to get¬†
in the future because i definitely like having it¬†¬† but that is the little dash cans as you can see it¬†
just connects up here and it just goes behind here¬†¬† and then plugs into your system but it just sits¬†
there and records whenever you turn the car on¬†¬† so um this is how you scroll and tune we're not¬†
going to press it i don't think it always unmutes¬†¬† um so then you've got the on and off button so if¬†
you wanted to you can just turn it off and then¬†¬† you can put the brightness on and off if we turn¬†
it and then if you press this once it comes back¬†¬† on then that turns the screen off and then you can¬†
turn it back on i'm not quite sure when you would¬†¬† need to use that but it's definitely handy to have¬†
then you've got your aircon system here so i love¬†¬† aircon i can't live without it especially when¬†
delivering cakes so you've just got hot and cold¬†¬† it's a bit old-fashioned in this sense the fact¬†
that you have dials but the actual productivity¬†¬† of your aircon or like the way that it works is¬†
very very good so that's why i wasn't put off¬†¬† um because i definitely remember in my first car¬†
when i had dials like this however the aircon¬†¬† did not work it was non-existent whereas this all¬†
worked very very well so that's why i don't mind¬†¬† my last car had digital and then you just typed¬†
in the um degree that you wanted it but obviously¬†¬† this one works perfectly fine so you just turn it¬†
like so pretty standard but the way that this one¬†¬† works is that is air comb when it's got the little¬†
snowflake and then you press it in and that's no¬†¬† longer air con so it still puts out cold air but¬†
obviously air con is very cold and cold air can be¬†¬† maybe like i don't know 16 degrees and then the¬†
air con goes lower than that um then we have i¬†¬† believe that is like the city um steering wheel¬†
where it makes your steering wheel a lot more¬†¬† loose i never use it and i don't want to press it¬†
just in case i end up leaving it on then you have¬†¬† your hazards and then you have your full beams so¬†
that's actually quite interesting because they're¬†¬† not on mine are usually on here but that's how you¬†
can flash people um if you want to like let them¬†¬† go or if you just need to put your full beams on¬†
i usually only use them when i'm flashing people¬†¬† to let them go um because i never really drive¬†
at night and then you've just got your various¬†¬† circulation so this one means it's taking air¬†
from inside the car and then this one it takes¬†¬† it from outside the castle it's kind of like¬†
fresh air um but if you just want to circulate¬†¬† the same air then you can use that then you've¬†
just got face air con facing feet just feet and¬†¬† then that is the fans onto your feet and then that¬†
is just this section up here um to do your dash¬†¬† um and then i'm not sure what these mean um¬†
this one i believe is your back window um and¬†¬† then that one is stop and start but i don't know¬†
what asr is and i believe that's your airbag um¬†¬† but yeah it has got stop and start so it means it¬†
doesn't do it when you're obviously like parked um¬†¬† but it does do it if you are at traffic lights and¬†
it will wait i don't know like maybe 10 seconds¬†¬† and then it will just stop and then the light¬†
will appear down here so as you can see it's¬†¬† only done 20 000 miles which we love that was¬†
one of the main reasons i got it because it was¬†¬† really low mileage and because it is financed for¬†
four years it means that when i give it back it's¬†¬† not going to have too many miles on it as you can¬†
see we're currently in neutral and it's in auto¬†¬† so if i show you we're just this is what you would¬†
drive in um so you would have it in neutral but¬†¬† then this is where you have it when you drive so¬†
neutral is when it's parked because it doesn't¬†¬† have a part then you have reverse so you just¬†
move it like that reverse and then if you move¬†¬† it to one side like so then you can see it goes¬†
into first um but if you just leave it like that¬†¬† again then it goes back into auto my dad just got¬†
home so um he just quickly interrupted the tour¬†¬† but let's get back into where i was i think i was¬†
showing you all of the dash so we're gonna go and¬†¬† start there so i'm just going to come back to this¬†
section of the dash so you've got your two windows¬†¬† which is always really good because obviously¬†
if there is no one in that side of the car then¬†¬† i'm not going to be able to reach or actually i¬†
can but it wouldn't be safe to reach um so yeah¬†¬† you've got both your windows here um this light¬†
was actually showing which i believe means that¬†¬† the passenger airbag isn't on so i'm gonna youtube¬†
that and set that so that it is on um these are¬†¬† actually fog lights my dad just corrected me um¬†
i'm used to having my fog lights on the actual¬†¬† stick but in this car they're press ones which¬†
i much prefer because in my old car they were¬†¬† very difficult you had to have your lights on¬†
auto and then you'd have to like pull the stick¬†¬† towards you do loads of stuff whereas obviously¬†
this is a lot easier you just press the button so¬†¬† we have our little um glove box here i've just¬†
got some air fresheners and then we've got two¬†¬† here this one actually isn't working anymore¬†
i just think it's cute and then jelly bean¬†¬† and then we just got a like when it's misty¬†
um on your dash like on the windscreen then¬†¬† you can just use that to wipe it i need to get¬†
some cloths for when it's icy later in the year¬†¬† then you have the book log book um down here¬†
i've just got a foil mat um it's kind of like¬†¬† a sheet and and i believe because my dad gave¬†
it to me that i can put it on the windscreen¬†¬† um when it's frosty and then it will reduce¬†
the amount of ice that's on my windscreen it¬†¬† won't completely stop it but it's meant to help¬†
apparently so on the side here is where you have¬†¬† your windows so this is how you switch sides so¬†
when it's on this side it's this window and then¬†¬† when it's this side it's that window um i had this¬†
on one of my other cars and it's fairly simple to¬†¬† navigate so you literally just push like that and¬†
then i don't know if you can oh yeah wrong one¬†¬† wrong mirror put that back up so¬†
as you can see the mirror is moving¬†¬† inside out so yeah that's just how you do that¬†
um it has got lock here so as you can see that's¬†¬† locked and then you just go like that to unlock it¬†
which i really like because it's really discreet¬†¬† um i always like to lock the car when i'm sat¬†
in it because i get why i read so it just means¬†¬† you can just go like that carl's lock nothing to¬†
worry about so yeah and then you just go like that¬†¬† to unlock it which is all good um so as i said¬†
you've got your little usb aux here if you want to¬†¬† plug in your phone rather than using bluetooth if¬†
you don't have any battery then you can do that um¬†¬† so here you have all your warning lights going¬†
around the edge obviously i've got no warning¬†¬† lights so that's why none of them are lit up then¬†
you've got your speed around the edge this bit¬†¬† you can customize i haven't got to that yet but i¬†
do want to have my speed in big letters on there¬†¬† at some point um and that's obviously where your¬†
gears are date time this is your fuel if you don't¬†¬† know that little arrow means that it's on the¬†
driver's side so it basically means whether you're¬†¬† um what is it petrol cap is on the left or right¬†
so if you don't know then that's where you look¬†¬† um i haven't gotten a seatbelt on so that's why¬†
that's up and that's for the handbrake this little¬†¬† light over here this is how you change the display¬†
i'm not familiar with that yet so i won't be doing¬†¬† anything but that is how you kind of navigate it¬†
um and then on the inside you've got your revs¬†¬† which if you're familiar with manual cars you'll¬†
know that when you sort of get to three and four¬†¬† on the rev count then you need to be going up¬†
a gear whereas obviously on auto it does it¬†¬† all for you um if you're using the semi auto¬†
then you will need to know how to use that¬†¬† so that is everything in regards to the¬†
dash then just on the wheel you've got¬†¬† um i believe that's hands-free then you've got¬†
mu volume up volume down your horn which we won't¬†¬† press horn either side this is how you change¬†
song that's how you answer the phone and that's¬†¬† how you put down your phone using hands-free¬†
um so we're going to turn off the engine now¬†¬† because we don't need that anymore so i wanted to¬†
show you this light because i really like these¬†¬† types of lights like the system um so this is when¬†
the doors open or you've just turned off the car¬†¬† it lights up and allows you time to get out the¬†
car as you can see it turns off then you have on¬†¬† if you just want it to stay on and then you have¬†
standard and then you can turn it off completely¬†¬† which is that way and then it won't come on at¬†
all whereas if you have it on in the middle then¬†¬† it means that if you open your doors it will¬†
come on then you do have an extra light in here¬†¬† which is always good you have a mirror that side¬†
but obviously you don't have a mirror this side¬†¬† because it would probably promote you to check¬†
your appearance while you're driving and obviously¬†¬† you do have this section here if you needed it¬†
then we have a sunroof which i love it's one¬†¬† of my favorite things about the car so what you¬†
do is you just go like that clip it in and then¬†¬† you've got a bit more kind of like shade um i use¬†
it like this if it's sunny and then i open it up¬†¬† when it's not sunny because it adds extra light¬†
you can't open it at all which i don't mind¬†¬† because it prevents any like leakage issues¬†
because like convertibles and things usually¬†¬† sometimes have leakage issues so it means¬†
that you don't have to worry about that¬†¬† because there's no opening so you just clip that¬†
back in and then you have little hooks around here¬†¬† on that side and also on that side i have bought¬†
extra ones i got these off ebay just to hang your¬†¬† handbags on um on the backs of the seat and¬†
then as you can see you've got your two seats¬†¬† i've pushed the headdresses right down but they do¬†
go up higher than that do not worry um and then we¬†¬† have our seat belts you can put these seats down¬†
there is a little clip right by that seat belt and¬†¬† you just push it and then you can put the seats¬†
down for extra room so that's always handy then¬†¬† you have your speakers in the door obviously it's¬†
a three door so these doors do not open and you¬†¬† open the back seats here and you just pull this¬†
like that and then you pull the chair towards you¬†¬† and you've got the same on this side like so and¬†
then pull the chair towards you and it will open¬†¬† and then it just slides the chair forward and¬†
then your passengers can get in the back we've¬†¬† got the cup holders as mentioned previously in¬†
this model which i got it's not standard but you¬†¬† have got maps um so these are the official fiat¬†
500 mats which again is a really nice addition¬†¬† then down there you have your bonnet opener i will¬†
give you a quick tour of the bonnet because i know¬†¬† with my last car tour people really wanted to see¬†
under the bonnet i obviously don't know anything¬†¬† about cars but i will give you a quick once-over¬†
of the bonnet so that you can have a look um¬†¬† so that is everything i believe in regards to the¬†
car um just a simple thing if you want to close¬†¬† and open your vents that's how you do it um but¬†
apart from that i believe that is everything about¬†¬† the car i'm gonna have a little look through the¬†
log book to cover anything that i might not know¬†¬† but this is the inside of my car i absolutely¬†
love it it is so cute and i love the auto i¬†¬† definitely recommend it to any manual drivers so¬†
i'm going to turn you around and give you a little¬†¬† outro so guys i hope you loved seeing my new¬†
car i've had it for about a week and a half¬†¬† um but i haven't done a car tour because i've been¬†
just busy um baking and various other things and¬†¬† also i was trying to sell my other car which¬†
actually went yesterday so after that sold it¬†¬† sold within like an hour so basically i listed it¬†
like a month ago and i had just loads of interest¬†¬† but nothing properly like no serious interest¬†
and then last night someone messaged me saying¬†¬† is the car still available can i view it tonight i¬†
said yes of course and then they came and view it¬†¬† bought it straight away um and that was that¬†
so they collected it yesterday so it was sold¬†¬† and gone yesterday evening so that was really¬†
nice it was just like a weight off my shoulders¬†¬† because obviously i'm paying for two cars so¬†
i wanted to get rid of it as quick as i could¬†¬† because i've currently got this car which i'm¬†
paying for and then i was also paying for that one¬†¬† which i will be paying off and then no longer¬†
have to worry about so i was getting a little bit¬†¬† worried that no one was gonna buy it but um yeah¬†
luckily we have a buyer and it's all sorted now so¬†¬† i don't have to worry about it um but that's kind¬†
of why i was like i'll do the car tour now because¬†¬† um i felt like i could kind of like¬†
rest easy because i had sold it¬†¬† um also there is something that i want to¬†
mention about the windscreen which i've forgotten¬†¬† um so i will insert that in a minute um but yeah¬†
so this is my new car and i absolutely love it¬†¬† um it's really nice and quirky i like the¬†
shape of it and everything um fiat 500 i've¬†¬† always wanted one but um i never had the money¬†
and i also always went for something cheaper¬†¬† and also because i always wanted a little¬†
run around whereas i was like maybe i should¬†¬† treat myself to a nice car that i really like¬†
not something i just want to run around in so¬†¬† i absolutely love it and i just love the interior¬†
it's my favorite thing um that and the sunroof is¬†¬† my favorite thing about the car and the fact that¬†
it's also so there's just so many things that i¬†¬† love about it um but yeah i'm gonna show you under¬†
the bonnet now and also show you the windscreen¬†¬† because i feel like it's something to mention¬†
because it is a three door so it definitely makes¬†¬† a difference so i'll quickly show you that what i¬†
wanted to mention about the windscreen is how wide¬†¬† it is so i don't know if you can tell but this¬†
is sort of maybe the normal width that you would¬†¬† get but as you can see you've got a bit extra¬†
either side so this pillar is very very small¬†¬† um in my last car it probably came to about here¬†
which obviously obstructs your view quite a bit¬†¬† um so i definitely think it makes a difference¬†
having it further out um so yeah i do really like¬†¬† the fact that it's a lot wider it definitely gives¬†
you a nice view especially when people are coming¬†¬† around the roundabout because there's a roundabout¬†
by my house which i used to always not be able to¬†¬† see at and it's where someone's coming around¬†
the roundabout from over there and you're going¬†¬† straight and i can't see them so i would really¬†
have to lean round this pillar here but this one¬†¬† because i think it's partly the fiat design but¬†
also because it's a three door and then you'll¬†¬† also be able to tell but the side windows are¬†
really big again usually four no five door cars¬†¬† will finish about here but because it's three door¬†
the windows are a lot bigger so it means that you¬†¬† have a lot more viewing space which i definitely¬†
like um it just means that your view isn't¬†¬† obstructed and yeah it's a lot easier to drive in¬†
it definitely makes a difference i haven't had a¬†¬† three-door for about three years so i am loving¬†
it because it's definitely something that i missed¬†¬† but yeah like i say the front is such a nice¬†
big window even my mum said the same thing¬†¬† when we drove home in it um but yeah it¬†
definitely makes a difference having that nice¬†¬† big window so just a quick look under¬†
the bonnet um how are we there we go i can't do it one hand so side is¬†
the little so down here you've got there you go put that in there and then i know¬†
people wanted to see under the bonnet in my last¬†¬† car so i just thought i'd give you a little tour¬†
but like i say i don't know anything about cars¬†¬† i think that's the battery and then you've¬†
got your um i don't know what that is sorry um¬†¬† we've got i believe this is radiator screen wash¬†
um this is your oil so you'll have a dipstick in¬†¬† there and your dipstick is here so that's how you¬†
check how much you've got in your oil tank so this¬†¬† is engine oil and if i'm saying that correctly¬†
and then yeah like i say that's your dipstick to¬†¬† check how much you've got in there um so yeah and¬†
then obviously you've got the main engine so i'm¬†¬† hoping that this covers any questions because¬†
i know people wanted to see under the bonnet¬†¬† but they didn't say specifically when i did¬†
my peugeot tour so i thought i'd just give you¬†¬† a little once over so that you can see what it¬†
looks like so yeah that is the bonnet and then¬†¬† like i say that's how you just take it¬†
out i can't do it one hand there we go¬†¬† so and then that just clips in down¬†
there and you just put it back down so that is everything for this video i hope you¬†
enjoyed if there's any questions you have about it¬†¬† please feel free to put them down below i know¬†
it's different to my usual types of videos but i'm¬†¬† hoping you enjoy because it is my new run around¬†
so it is relating to me and it's kind of like a¬†¬† life update um but yeah let me know if you've got¬†
a fiat 500 what you think of it and also whether¬†¬† you have any questions about the model anything¬†
about this particular one because i know that¬†¬† it's got quite a few add-ons than the standard¬†
model so definitely feel free to ask anything¬†¬† because there might be something that's on my car¬†
which won't be on the standard ones so yeah if you¬†¬† want me to check anything for you please feel free¬†
to comment it down below if you haven't already¬†¬† please like subscribe and hit the bell and you'll¬†
be notified about all my new videos bye guys you"

Ahora me estoy planteando un 500 peque√±ito para m√≠ s√≥lo con los hijos mayores, teniendo en cuenta que conservo el Multipla para mis hijos y por si tengo que necesitar un buen maletero. Para m√≠, ahora que los coches se hacen tan bajos, la conducci√≥n alta de Fiat es una delicia.<br><br>El cambio del Multipla tambi√©n es igual, es muy suave.

Pues he vuelto a los peque√±os con un 500 hace 2 meses. Apenas hay oferta en coches peque√±os, y sin duda este es una opci√≥n muy buena para un uso diario, combinando ciudad y algo de autopista, por: consumo, confort, est√©tica y m√°s razones. La verdad es que, si no se rompe, creo que mi decisi√≥n es m√°s que acertada. Incluso repetir√≠a con otro cuando el m√≠o envejezca, cosa que con mis anteriores coches no me he planteado. No es un coche ni para flipados de la velocidad o conducci√≥n deportiva, ni familias con ni√±os, ni gente que pretende cruzar Europa con su coche. Pero para el uso que yo le doy (suelo ir solo, y ocasionalmente puede que lleve a gente atr√°s) ha resultado perfecto. Muy recomendable! Y el video muy conseguido y muy did√°ctico.

No es un coche ni para flipados de la velocidad o conducci√≥n deportiva, ni familias con ni√±os, ni gente que pretende cruzar Europa con su coche.

Lejos qued√≥ esos coches peque√±os como el Renault wind, o Ford ka. Una pena q desaparecieran fueran m√°s guapos o feos. Este 500 con este tipo de techo creo q es un rara avis q si no me equivoco siempre  estuvo. Me comentaron q estos Fiat tan &quot;sencillitos&quot; no est√°n saliendo malos. Quiz√° como segundo coche estar√≠a bien y algo diferente para un d√≠a playero aunque los cabrio creo q son mejores para d√≠as nublados y calurosos, atardeceres o noche, pero qui√©n no se imagina ir a la playita descapotao... Imagino q es mucho m√°s caro f√°bricar cualquier veh√≠culo cabrio de hecho hasta los Jimmy dejaron de serlo antes de este √∫ltimo modelo y ese estaba mucho m√°s chulo para m√≠ descapotado y aunque tragases bichos y polvo a raudales, se disfrutaba mucho m√°s del Campo...  Ojal√° vuelva un poco la moda del cabrio y con espacio  q tecnolog√≠a hay.

Ik ben ook geen fan van Fiat maar geen stroompunt achterin? Geen dubbele bodem in de kofferbak? De buitenspiegels trillen iets bij stationair draaien? Misschien te veel grote Chinese duracelauto‚Äôs getest‚Ä¶', 'eigenaardig  dat jij  trilling  hebt, ik heb er geen ,  en doe   1/20  verbruik .', 'Alle Duitse testen positief maar nee hij niet', 'Heb nu ruim 1.5 jr de 500 twin turbo cult 80 pk ge chip tuned door Savali naar 105 pk ik haal er met overwegend binnenwegen en een verderlichte rechter voet 1 op 19,5 mee da&#39;s heul wat anders dan 1 op 13 bakstenen voet hebbende anwb testers!! En veel geluid maken, nee met 1900 tpm kruisend op 75 km/h is hij fluisterstil nog stiller dan de 1.2 V4 die ik daarvoor 4 jr en 68k reed. Wat de tester niet snapt en Jeffrey Clarkson dan weer 100%  is dat de motor een geweldige grom afgeeft als je &#39;m goed op z,n staart trapt en doorhaalt naar 7000 tpm. Heb je niet eens een sportuitlaat en andere fratsen bij nodig. In het kort gezegd: RIJPLEZIER. Wat wel waar is, wil je een 500 koop je &#39;m ook en icoon, zonder meer. Dit gaat dus zeker niet mijn laatste 500 zijn mensen, wat een lekkere compacte auto, heerlijke hoge zit dus goed zicht rondom, goedkoop in gebruik en onderhoud, tijdloos retro 50 design, veel luxe, cabrio enfin wat wil je nog meer voor dat geld. Het is bijna als de panda reclame: je blijft lachen en lacht iedereen vet uit.', 'Ga jij anders even semi nonchalant tegen die paal staan, met je voet ertegenaan.', 'Ik heb zelf met een 500c twinair gereden. Niks mis mee en de auto geeft je een premium gevoel.', 'Het gewijzigde (US model) dashboard met dashboardkastje zit er sinds 2016 in.<br>Verder rijd ik met mijn 2017 500C  TwinAir 80 Dualogic makkelijk <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz3akgPo3mo&amp;t=79"">1:19</a>.', 'Duitse tests waren lovend', 'Helaas kan je achterin ook niet de radio bedienen op de hoofdsteunen..... en kan je er ook geen caravan mee trekken.', 'Een hoop geld voor een truttenschuddertje.... Geef mij maar de iets grotere Panda met zijn twin-air. Meer fun om mee te rijden, zeker als je de turbo gebruikt.', 'Weet iemand hoe het outro liedje heet', 'Fiat doet iets goed als ze dit model al j√°ren kunnen verkopen met minimale wijzigingen.', 'Geen beste review. En niet alleen omdat die Twin Air veel meer pret levert dan deze variant die niet bedoeld lijkt om te consument een lol te doen, maar om op papier de emissiecijfers van de fabrikant aan EU-regeltjes te laten voldoen. Ook omdat een Twin Air niet hoeft te zuipen. Hij roept wel continu tegen je dat hij er zin in heeft, vooral ook omdat die w√©l al bij lage toeren bij de les is. Je hoeft die dus juist ni√©t op toeren te jagen. En als dat dashboardkastje je nu pas opvalt (zit er al jaren in), het geluid niet leuk vindt of serieus probeert achterin deze auto te gaan zitten, dan snap je er niet veel van. Enfin de verkoopcijfers spreken boekdelen. Het verhaal had dus een veel minder sneue toon mogen hebben.', 'Een auto die ik nooit zou kopen. Maar je maakt er wel een hebbeding van üòäüëç', 'mijn Dacia Sandro Stepway is nog zuiniger...Ik haal een verbruik van 1 op 16-17', 'Zo vreemd üòÖ, de 3 cilinder in de 500x (gse firefly) is misschien wel 1 van de soepelste in zijn klasse en hier schudt de hele auto, zegt dit dan meer over de motor of de bouwkwaliteit van de 500?üôÑ', 'Weet zeker dat hij op 98, dus ethanol vrij ook verder komt en zuiniger.', 'Fiat rijt nooit fijn en zuinig op 95 e10', 'Het verbruik van de twinair is sterk afhankelijk van je rijstijl. De twinair in mijn punto scoort over 20000 km een gemiddelde van 1 op 16, maar ook waardes van 1 op 18 zijn voor bij gekomen. Daarbij de heeft de twinair een temperamentvol karakter, echt Italiaans zullen we maar zeggen!', 'tankdop hoef je niet zo over het klepje te hangen...daar zit een mooi haakje aan', 'Altijd een leuke auto gevonden. Wel als 2e auto want t is allemaal niet praktisch. Jammer dat de karakteristieke Twinair er niet meer is.', '1 op 20 haal je makkelijk', 'Kan echt zuiniger', 'Wij hebben een 500 van 2009 en daar zit een kleine klepje bij de Dashboard plank. Daar kunnen pasjes in.', 'Een stroompunt ontbreekt... t is een 500... geen mercedes..', 'Geinig om te zien.. ik hoef geen fiat.', 'Net een video van TheStraitPipes gezien met zeer mooie donkergroene 6.4 liter Challenger....en dan weer terug naar Nederlandse video&#39;s en ja hoor. Een overdekte winkelwagen  brrrr', 'LEUK üöóüöòüëç', 'Niet zo negatief over de twinair.<br>Heb er zelf √©√©n in een Punto liggen en vind dat het ook wel wat charme hebben. En het is niet alleen maar negatief', 'Verbruik valt inderdaad tegen, ik had beter verwacht.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR1Aa9zA5N4,Autophorie,2020-05-31T16:00:10Z,66077,"['Wir sind einen Probe gefahren weil die Frau sich Dach eingebildet hat. Das Gel√§nde in der Probefahrt war etwas üòÇh√ºgelig. Ich Vergleich zum jetzigen Auto, Ford Fiesta 1l EcoBoost 101PS, zieht der 500er kein Schnitzel vom Teller. So lange Fiat keinen st√§rkeren Motor anbietet, ist der 500C raus. Schade.', 'Ein √ºei :)', 'Fahre selbst den 500er in der Ausstattung Hey Google ohne Cabrio-Dach und bin so begeistert ... selbst 350 km am St√ºck hat der Hintern problemlos weggesteckt.', 'Klasse Review üòä<br>Kritikpunkt beim ‚ÄûHybrid‚Äú: Sollte die Hauptbatterie aufgrund von langer Standzeit oder Verschlei√ü einmal ihren Geist quittieren, ist es extrem frustrierend, dass gerade die HYBRID-Variante die extra Batterie, die in einem solchen Falle sogar beinahe voll geladen ist (Selbsterfahrung) ihren Strom zum Starten des Fahrzeugs partout nicht freigibt. Somit muss man sich trotz beinahe voller Zweitbatterie anderweitige Starthilfe organisieren.<br>Das ist doof.', 'Ab wie viel kmh  schaltet sich der Motor ein und der Elektromotor aus ??', 'Gibt&#39;s ihn auch mit Automatik,auch ohne Fetzendach??', 'Bin den in Italien durch Zufall als Mietauto gefahren. Unglaubliches Fahrgef√ºhl. Laufruhig wie eine Limousine, die Schaltung f√ºhlt sich super gut an und er ‚Äöklebt‚Äò f√∂rmlich auf der Fahrbahn - und all das bei 90kmh+ und Landstra√üe. Kann mir sogar vorstellen, damit l√§ngere Strecken zu fahren. Verbrauch war in Italien unter 3l/100km, allerdings gibt‚Äòs da auch kaum Ampeln üòâ', 'schick    -    hat sich meine Mutter vor einer h gekauft   -   gef√§llt mir gut', 'Mir gef√§llt das Autochen im Hinblick auf Optik, Haptik und Variabilit√§t. Aber der Hybrid ist wirklich so etwas, √ºber das man ob seiner vielen anderen positiven Seiten bei dem kleinen Charmebolzen hinweg sehen sollte, im eigenen Interesse. Der Antrieb hat nicht ansatzweise das Temperament meines einstigen 900ccm Polo 1 mit wackeren 40 PS, schlie√ülich auch einige Zentner mehr an Bord. Die √úberholvorg√§nge auf der tendenziell weniger √ºbersichtlichen Landstra√üe sind ein deutlicher Restrisikofaktor. Ob der Schnuckel seine 160 auf der Autobahn nach einigen Meilen packt oder nicht, daf√ºr ist er eh nicht gemacht, wen interessiert¬¥s also. Mir w√ºrde es eher zusagen, wenn er blo√ü 130 &quot;br√§chte&quot; daf√ºr aber deutlich flotter beschleunigen k√∂nnte auf der Landstra√üe. Ihn heute wiederholt als Leihwagen gefahren, begeisternd ist der Vortrieb einfach nicht, w√ºrde ihn darum selbst gebraucht nicht erwerben wollen. Das elektrische Faltdach super praktisch, da unkompliziert. Seitenscheiben runter und fertig ist das Cabriofeeling, definitiv! Allerdings weniger was f√ºr Poser, die Wert drauf legen, im Auto gesehen zu werden, denn so tief geht das Faltdach hinten nicht runter. Insofern eine minimale Einschr√§nkung zum &quot;Vollcabrio&quot;, f√ºr Leute wie mich unerheblich.', 'Gestern frisch √ºbernommen. Bin beeindruckt von dem Motor. Selbst Die Autobahnetappe war okay. Macht Spa√ü der Wagen!', 'Er macht richtig Laune - dieser kleine Italiener! - Doch selbst das Stella-Wei√ü war mir als Frau schon zu rosa. Ich habe dann mit voller Leidenschaft zu &quot;Gelatto-Wei√ü&quot; gegriffen! Plus rotes Dach! Einfach wie es geh√∂rt. Bin sehr begeistert - wie gesagt - reinsteigen und schon hast Du gute Laune! üåπüå∫‚ù§Ô∏è‚òòÔ∏èüòâüëçü§©Danke f√ºr den tollen Test! Ersetzt heutzutage das INfo- und Verkaufsgespr√§ch, weil man ja nichts mehr bekommt und machen darf. Keine Besichtigung, kein Austausch, keine Probefahrt! Das meine ich.', 'A die Herren', 'Als Zweitwagen haben wir den 500ter mit 4 Zylindern. Als echter Hybrid h√§tte ich es mir √ºberlegt den einzutauschen, aber so eher nicht.', 'Ich habe mir letztes Jahr einen neuen 500er Serie 6 in Lounge Ausstattung mit 42% Preisnachlass gekauft aber wenn ich geahnt h√§tte, dass so einer kommt, h√§tte ich den genommen.', 'ich h√§tte mir gerne ein Automatikgetriebe gew√ºnscht. Aber sonst top', 'Fahre selbst einen Lancia Delta der 3. Generation mag den kleinen aber auch sehr gern hab ja auch tag t√§glich damit zu tun da ich im Fiat Autaus arbeite und bei uns gehen die kleinen auch wie warme Semmeln und die ersten Hybrids sind auch schon weg.', 'üëéüëéüëéüëé', 'Der 500 ist extrem ausgereift . Und sehr gut verarbeitet . Leider f√§llt er immer in Frauen Hand . Die es mit Wartung nicht so genau nehmen. Meine Bekannte antwortet darauf , ich war einmal beim Fiat H√§ndler , der wollte fast 400 Euro haben . Bin doch nicht bescheuert .Der Wagen ist mittlerweile 6 Jahre alt , mit dem ersten  Oel . Reifendruck vom Aussehen wie Plattfu√ü . Frauen tut mir einen kleinen Gefallen . M√§nner haben f√ºr Euch andere Maschinen gebaut . ( Waschmaschinen Trockner B√ºgeleisen etc. Oder geht zur Fahrschule Sabine Schmitz .Die kann Euch eine Menge beibringen .', 'Gut Farbe ist null meins, aber Fiat hat den richtigen Schritt gemacht f√ºr alle die kein Auto aufladen k√∂nnen und trotzdem mobil bleiben m√∂chten - genial simple L√∂sung im schicken Design mit 6 G√§ngen üëç!', 'Tolles Auto üëç. Toller Test üëç!<br><br>Sehr cooler ehrlicher Test!!!<br><br>Super Kaufberatung üëåüëçüëå!', 'Verfolge die 500er, und als Kerl gerade die Abarths schon lange. Zu diesem Motor kann man nur Daumen hoch geben. Und wie bekommt man das ganze hin? Genau man nutzt altbekannte formelelemente. So viel Hubraum wie n√∂tig, der Motor sparsam und laufruhig abgestimmt. Dann kurze aber viele g√§nge um den Motor immer im ideal Bereich zu halten. Anschlie√üen ein bisschen Elektro drann Schrauben damit anfahrschw√§chen bzw. das anfahren erleichtert wird, um spitzenlast abzufedern. Und fertig ist der niedrige Verbrauch. Jetzt noch ordentlich Luft auf die leichtrollreifen, mit leichten Felgen und ab geht es. Und im Zweifel l√§uft die Kiste auch wenn die batterie mal Probleme macht noch zur Werkstatt bzw. der ganze M√ºll der entsteht wird etwas eingegrenzt. Meiner Meinung nach w√§re ein cng Triebwerk noch ein bisschen eleganter gewesen, vielleicht kommt ja sowas noch ins Portfolio. Vw bietet den up mit 1l und 68 PS cng bei 90nm, nur als Anmerkung :)', 'Das Hubschrauberger√§usch l√§sst sich mit dem Windabweiser mit einem kurzen Griff zum Hebel  √ºber dem Dachverschluss beheben..', 'Der Motor scheint aber v√∂llig neu zu sein mit 3-Zylinder, 999cm3, der Twin Air hatte nur 2-Zylinder mit 875cm3, sch√∂n das FIAT auch mal einen guten Motor hat.<br>Cabriolimousine  ist sowieso praktischer, ab dem Ersten Sonnenstrahl zu jeder Jahreszeit einsetzbar.', 'Tolle Felgen-/lack combo.<br>Technisch klasse, aber es bleibt ein veraltetes, wenig dauer haltbares Produkt.<br>Christian', 'Dankbar.', 'Wie kann man sich diese &quot;Stadt&quot; eigentlich vorstellen. Es gibt ja St√§dte, da kann man sch√∂n durchrollen und dann aber gibt es auch St√§dte, wo man st√§ndig um Kurven f√§hrt, viele Ampeln hat ect, so dass man h√§ufig bremsen und beschleunigen muss. Das wirkt sich erheblich auf den Verbrauch aus.<br>Auto selbst: Preislich halt v√∂llig abgehoben was Fiat da verlangt. Aber gut, so lange es Leute gibt die es kaufen, macht man es ja &quot;richtig&quot;.', 'Fiat schafft es trotz 12 Jahren Bauzeit den 500er immer noch attraktiv zu halten. Die vielen Farbkombinationen und Details sind typisch italienisch. Meine Frau und meine T√∂chter sind diesem Charme schon seit vielen Jahren erlegen.<br>Zudem laufen unsere 500er alle teilweise seit 12 Jahren absolut problemlos.', 'Bald mit H-Kennzeichen ab Werk!', 'Cabrio ist das Keines. Dazu m√ºssten die Dachholme verschwinden üòÇ Danke f√ºr das sch√∂ne Video üëç', 'Immerhin: Zwei T√ºren und Handschaltung - da kann man heutzutage nicht meckern.', 'Langsam schafft ihr es wirklich mich davon zu √ºberzeugen das ein Mildhybrid wirklich Kraftstoff spart üòâüëç Und das bei meiner grunds√§tzlichen (bis jetzt) nicht gerade positiven Meinung zu Hybriden allgemein. Gibt extra Daumen hoch üòâüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç<br><br>Ich finde es gut wie Du Dich auskennst und erkl√§ren kannst, w√ºrde manchen Autoverk√§ufern gut zu Gesicht stehen.<br><br>Mein allererstes Auto war ein Fiat 500, allerdings Baujahr 1969, brauchte aber im Schnitt auch nur 5L.

Macht es gut und bleibt gesund üôèüëçüòéüëã', 'Es ist vielleicht nicht der beste Kleinstwagen auf dem Markt, aber f√ºr mich mit Abstand der Sch√∂nste.<br>Ich bin ja sonst eher empf√§nglich f√ºr sportliche und gut motorisierte Kompaktwagen, aber beim 500C w√ºrde ich einfach nur das Dach runtermachen und genie√üen :D', 'Mit welchem realen Verbrauch meint ihr kann man den kleinen fahren?', 'Ich liebe den kleinen...egal in welcher Version:-)', 'Also eines muss man den damaligen Designer lassen, das Design wirkt immer noch nicht altbacken.']","['2024-06-09T06:42:38Z', '2024-04-20T17:52:21Z', '2024-02-14T23:20:32Z', '2023-06-14T08:57:24Z', '2023-04-03T11:05:41Z', '2022-10-30T17:55:55Z', '2022-07-29T17:56:55Z', '2022-05-21T15:52:12Z', '2021-06-14T21:13:46Z', '2021-05-01T08:13:04Z', '2021-03-27T08:32:53Z', '2020-09-22T19:54:17Z', '2020-08-18T13:09:24Z', '2020-07-22T15:22:14Z', '2020-07-04T10:49:34Z', '2020-06-06T16:53:39Z', '2020-06-05T09:55:32Z', '2020-06-02T18:05:06Z', '2020-06-02T16:23:39Z', '2020-06-02T16:15:32Z', '2020-06-02T14:17:15Z', '2020-06-01T21:39:55Z', '2020-06-01T19:37:12Z', '2020-06-01T14:20:38Z', '2020-06-01T09:23:39Z', '2020-06-01T08:03:17Z', '2020-06-01T03:35:16Z', '2020-05-31T19:24:32Z', '2020-05-31T18:37:28Z', '2020-05-31T17:50:18Z', '2020-05-31T17:35:33Z', '2020-05-31T16:54:32Z', '2020-05-31T16:45:58Z', '2020-05-31T16:38:42Z', '2020-05-31T16:33:58Z']","Transcript not available:

Weiter so!', 'Hallo, ich fahre seit 2015 einen Fiat 500 1.2 Bj. 2014, habe ihn mit 10000 km gekauft. Es war nicht geplant das ich das W√§gelchen l√§nger als ein Jahr behalte. F√ºr den Arbeitsweg bevorzuge ich die √ñV. In der Zwischenzeit hat er 85&#39;000km runter und habe bisher nur die Bremsscheiben vorne und den Zahnriemen gewechselt, das kleine Auto ist absolut zuverl√§ssig. Vor allem gef√§llt mir der leise Motor, die Laufruhe und das gute Fahrwerk. Auf deutschen Autobahnen dr√ºcke ich ihn schon mal gerne, Wohlf√ºhltempo f√ºr mich dabei 150 km/h, bei diesem Tempo habe ich den Kleinen noch im Griff. Doch in der Schweiz fahre ich auf der Autobahn in meiner Region (Deutschschweiz) eher einen Durchschnitt von 100km/h, es gibt wenige Autobahn-Streckenabschnitte in der Schweiz wo man noch 120km/h l√§nger fahren kann. Somit reichen f√ºr mich die 69 Ps in den meisten Situationen aus, dabei unterlasse ich nat√ºrlich riskante Man√∂ver. Spass macht der Cinquino auf jeden Fall.

Nicht zu vergessen, gerade der gefahrene Motor ist praktisch unkaputtbar, nicht mal ein Zahnriemenri√ü w√ºrde ihn killen, da er ein Freil√§ufer ist. Ich hab diesen Motor selber bis 190000km und 17 Jahre Alter gefahren und er schnurrte wie eine Katze. Bei einem Dichtungswechsel bei 170000km wurde mir von der Werkstatt gesagt, innen sieht der Motor aus wie neu, keinerlei Verschlei√ü feststellbar, voller Hohnschliff vorhanden, nicht wie im VAG Konzern √ºblich, wo nach 150000km die Zylinderinnenw√§nde katastrophal aussehen und der √ñlverbrauch steigt und steigt.', 'üòèüí¶', 'Ich bin am √ºberlegen, ob ich mir einen Fiat 500 als erstes Auto kaufen soll... <br>Ich bin noch in der Lehre und habe daher keine Lust, st√§ndig Reparatur zu zahlen...<br>Was sagt ihr zum fiat 500 als Gebrauchtwagen?', 'Tolles Video!

Insgesamt ist er jetzt 20000 km gerannt. Das bei zu 99 prozentigem Langstreckenbetrieb. Bisher funktioniert alles tadellos und das Auto stellte sich bis jetzt als durchaus zuverl√§ssig dar. V.a. beim Kaltstart, oder wenn das Auto l√§nger gestanden hat (speziell jetzt in den kalten Wintermonaten, wenn auch in der Garage) l√§uft der Motor teilweise sehr unruhig und es sind kleine Z√ºndaussetzer bemerkbar. Beim letzten Kaltstart hat man auch deutliche Schlagger√§usche aus dem Motorraum wahrnehmen k√∂nnen. <br>Der Fiat Panda meiner Freundin (gleiche Motorisierung) zeigt √§hnliche Probleme, was die Aussage des Reporters st√ºtzt.

Der Fiat 500c ist nicht billig, Hartplastik wird innen viel verbaut, jedoch ist das Design Au√üen wie auch Innen sch√∂n anzusehen.

Ich muss gestehen das es das erste Auto in meinem Leben ist das mich vom Design aber auch vom Fahren so abgeholt hat.

Dennoch mag ich den 500, meine Frau hatte ihren 6 Jahre und rund 160.000 km, ohne Probleme bis auf eine defekte Z√ºndspule. Das Auto macht in engen Stra√üen richtig Spa√ü und es geht auch Langstrecke damit. Der Verbrauch mit etwa 5,3 l/100 km ging auch in Ordnung, alles in allem empfehlenswert. Das Video ist informativ und ich bin mit Dir der Meinung, dass der 500 Spa√ü macht.', 'Den Bericht fand ich besonders unterhaltsam, liegt vielleicht am kleinen Flitzer.

Aber umso √§lter er wurde, desto √∂fters sieht man die √ºbertrieben teuren Fiatwerkst√§tten von innen, in denen wohl kein Mechaniker was taugt. Ich musste nach jeder Reparatur zur Nachbesserung, die meisten haben da dann auch noch versucht die Hand aufzuhalten. Freie Werkst√§tten sind eine L√∂sung, am Besten sobald die Garantie rum ist. Kulanz hab ich von Fiat nie gesehen, hatte aber auch kein gr√∂√üeres Problem, daf√ºr laufend kleine Sachen um 100-200 Euro, wie einen durchgescheuerten Kabelbaum an der Kofferraumklappe nach 4(!)

Daf√ºr bekam man in den 90ern einen waschechten Sportwagen oder alternativ eine Gro√üraumlimousine - mit einem ORDENTLICHEN Motor. Winziger Hubraum mit Turbo ist ein Trick: Es ist billiger bei derselben Leistung, allerdings, wie du grad meintest, muss der Motor hoch drehen. Damit verschleisst er auch schneller. Nach 4-5 Jahren kannst du das Ding wegschmeissen, bzw so lange fahren, bis er schlapp macht, denn einen Wiederverkaufwert wird er nicht haben. Der Verbrauch ist eine Katastrophe! Kein Wunder, der kleine Motor haut sehr schnell Masse rauf und runter, das erzeugt Hitze statt Drehmoment. Sorry, das ganze Konzept dieser Winzmotoren ist Verarsche. Ich kenne das von 8000‚Ç¨-Fahrzeugen wie Dacia, selbst bei Renault Clio (was ja Dasselbe ist). Da wei√ü man aber, was man kauft und was man kriegt, und selbst da verbraucht man max 6.5l/100km, da finde ich das aber OK. Aber 25000‚Ç¨ f√ºr dieses Spielzeug? Das ist absoluter Abfuck!! Abzocke mit &quot;Lifestyle&quot;-Werbung. Ich fahre wg. Family und tiefstem Dorf einen superkomfortablen aber untermotorisierten (nur 150PS)  SUV, der verbraucht nur 1.5l mehr als die Glitzerkugel  :-D  Alter, da hast du aber das Schlechteste aus beiden Welten erwischt. Wenn du bereit bist, diesen Preis f√ºr so eine Seifenkiste zu bezahlen und knackige Motoren magst, hol dir lieber einen geilen Stromer oder, falls du nicht zu Hause laden kannst, gibt¬¥s f√ºr diesen Preis richtige Cabrios mit besseren Leistungen. Wenn das Ding unter 10k kosten w√ºrde, w√§re der Preis gerechtfertigt.

I invite you to test the Fiat 500C, a veteran of the automotive market in Poland, who, however, is not going to retire yet. The letter C in the name means that we are dealing here with a version with a folding roof, which makes the test car even more interesting and about what the conversion of the 500 into a convertible looks like and how to drive in our autumn conditions I will tell you such a car later in the video between others. We start! Speaking of the fact that the presented car is a veteran, I meant that the debut of this model took place in 2007. The Fiat 500 was, of course, modernized and adapted to modern standards during this time, but the body design of the 500 was still as it was at the time of its premiere. This is not a complaint in my opinion, as this model stands up to the passage of time really well. This is largely due to the idea for its design, because the hero of this test was to be kept in a retro atmosphere from the very beginning and refer to the Fiat 500 from the 1950s. This, combined with the delicate lines that are simply pleasing to the eye, still gives a satisfactory effect. Although I still regret that the new generation of this model sold in parallel is only electric, because it looks nicer than the combustion engine while maintaining a similar character. As the name suggests, the Red version focuses on adding red elements to the test car. That is, we have inserts on the pillars, doors or rims. Red also means a better level of equipment, so the rims are 15 inches and are aluminum. There is also red in the interior, as well as oval shapes, which make the interior of the cabin invisible too much time. I mean, of course, you can see a bit, but the whole thing looks nice in its specificity and you feel that someone had a specific idea for this space. The 500 position behind the wheel is also specific, because for such a small car you sit really high here and it is a strange impression. And I will not say that I am a fan of such a solution, but you can get used to it somehow. In addition, the chair as a whole is not adjustable in height, and you can only change the position of the seat part and also its angle, which does not make any big difference. The roof is fully electric. We have two buttons responsible for this, because the 500C is not such a typical convertible and the side door stays in it normally with frames. The whole procedure can also be done at higher speeds. I steered the roof even at almost 100 km/h without the protests of the computer. There are several positions to which the whole structure rolls up or unfolds, as long as it is not constantly holding onto the button. This is what a car without a roof looks like. Despite keeping the sides, the exposed space is large here, so you can feel the wind in your hair without any problems while driving. When driving a convertible, you will see much less what is behind the car. After the roof is unfolded, the visibility is better and although the rear window is smaller than the regular 500, the small size of the car, regardless of which version, means that it is not a problem to be able to sense when driving backwards somewhere. Moving forward is also good, although the shape does not quite make it easy. That is, we have a very cut front, the hood is not visible at all, the windscreen is noticeably tilted. Well, again, the dimensions do their job and maneuvering the tested Fiat is generally very easy. Accordingly, the lack of a rear view camera does not bother here. The sensors' indications are signaled on the clocks. The lack of a roof in the Fiat 500 means its higher price, because the regular Red version costs PLN 72,400, and the convertible costs PLN 81,400. These are not small amounts, even by modern standards, but the 500 is also not an ordinary model, which you buy with only common sense in your head, so you have to take the correction for it. You should also bear in mind that in the tested Fiat you cannot count on powerful engines, because this car can only be ordered with a naturally aspirated 1.0 gasoline unit generating 70 HP and equipped with a soft hybrid system. The Red version, as I mentioned, means a better level of equipment and, interestingly, the name of this variety does not only refer to the color scheme, but means cooperation with an organization called Red, which supports the fight against diseases and in the car to counteract them. For example, the steering wheel or seats have been covered with an antibacterial coating, and the cabin filter is soaked in a biocidal substance. Returning to the equipment in the red version, you can count on a decent level for such a small car, i.e. with manual air conditioning, central screen, 7 inches, cruise control or parking sensors. But still, in order to graze like a test car, you have to pay a little extra for electronic clocks, navigation, automatic air conditioning or xenon, which means the total cost of almost PLN 90,000. Getting the 500C out of hand is not easy now, and the changes to model year 2023, including price lists, are yet to come. Therefore, to say how much money for 500 you need to prepare more or less, if someone would like to take it in long-term rental, I will use the offer for a slightly retrofitted version with a Dolcevita hardtop , which is available on the website of the Wahacz TV partner, CarLease Polska. For the parameters of the rental, let's assume a two-year period of its duration, a zero own payment and an annual limit of 20,000 kilometers. And then the monthly installment including the costs of inspections and operating parts is PLN 923 net or PLN 1136 gross. You can fine- tune the offer according to your preferences by clicking on the link that I have placed in the description of the film. And on carleasepolska.pl there are many other models, also under operating lease. Now it's time to talk about whether it is worth spending more for the roofless version. If I tested this car in the summer, my answer would be definitely yes, because the convertible offers a very different driving experience. And without a doubt it is the most fun incarnation of the 500. The more so as leaving the side parts intact means that you do not feel as exposed to the surroundings as in a regular convertible. Unfortunately, my 500C test took place in the fall and the temperatures were closer to 10 degrees Celsius and then the ride was not so pleasant. I mean, when I got to the day where it was 16 degrees, the jacket was still great. And on this basis, I say that it must also be like this in summer. At 11 degrees, however, I already felt the cold wind too much, my hands were freezing, I was afraid of catching a cold and it was generally more pleasant to ride with the roof closed. Therefore, the 500 convertible is worth buying, but you have to do it consciously. Ie. Knowing that in our climate, this car will show its full potential for about 4 months a year, and in the remaining ones, a folding roof may result in, for example, the need for more heating of the interior, because in the case of canvas with insulation guaranteed by sheet metal, there is nothing to say. Convertible also means worse soundproofing of the cabin. But since the regular 500 is not the quietest at high speeds anyway, the differences are not disqualifying. The good thing about the folding mechanism of the roof is that it has several positions, and just as with the maximum offset, the wind on the back of the head feels strong, while when it is only half-stretched, it largely disappears. Reaching 100 km / h takes the tested Fiat 13.8 seconds and during some more precise acceleration the situation with dynamics is not any better. That is, in higher gears, it takes 4,000 revolutions to get the most out of the car. And on highways, it still means the need for more conscious maneuver planning. At city speeds, the situation looks better and there you do not have to look at the revs so much and you can easily get performance that allows you to move efficiently. Outside the built-up area. The 500 is also fully usable, you just need to be aware that it is a car with an urban drive system and not intended for travel, e.g. with maximum passenger and luggage load, and then you can reach your destination in a relaxed manner. 1 liter gasoline in the tested model has 3 cylinders and you can hear it while driving, because the engine has quite a braid characteristic and in terms of work culture differs from the latest turbo-equipped constructions, while the sound did not bother me with the roof closed or open. The engine is equipped with a soft hybrid system, which is to improve smoothness in its starting, assist acceleration, and at low speeds, allow you to sail at idle, with gas turned off and other systems in use. The operation of the hybrid does not affect the driving experience much, but the 500 is still an economical car, because on ordinary extra-urban roads it uses an average of 4.5 liters per 100 km, 5.5 liters on expressways, and 6-6.5 liters at highway speeds. . In Warsaw, on the other hand, the car consumed 5.5 liters and in the city I sometimes missed the possibility to choose the machine from the configurator, but if some things do not skip and the ordinary gearbox in traffic jams is more burdensome, the manual in the 500C is a really successful design, because it is characterized by with good precision, it also has short lever strokes and a quite pleasant, bouncy working style. The only thing I don't like is the finish, because the plastic looks pretty cheesy on the knob, but other than that, the people from Fiat put some effort into the gearbox. Partially electronic clocks with a 7-inch display are an option in a PLN 2,000 package. They come with navigation, they have been quite neatly integrated into the surroundings. As for the informative content, all the most important things related to driving parameters tracking are. You can also monitor the operation of the hybrid system and that would be it. There aren't any big fireworks here, but all the essentials are there. The instrument cluster also includes a menu that is controlled by these little buttons here, which are normally used to change the height of the lights. There aren't many things here to tune in and all in all fine as it's not comfortable. Even the manufacturer was aware of this , as this menu is mostly unavailable while driving. You can only control the strength of the backlight. One button on the right lever is responsible for changing the messages that I showed a moment ago, the average fuel consumption, etc. , which means that you can only scroll one way after this list. The indicator lights are used as standard with the lever on the left side. Unfortunately, it is poorly designed, because you have to deflect it too long and too precisely for the mechanism to click into place. At first, I thought this type of feature didn't work at all here. Only later did I find out , checking several times that it works, but unfortunately it works really poorly. The buttons on the steering wheel are used to control the phone and the audio system in a very easy way, but with such a small number of these controls, it would be difficult to do otherwise. The uConnect entertainment info system has a 7-inch screen and in some modules with very numerous clickable elements, a slightly larger diagonal would not hurt. The touch response of this screen is really good. The quality is also pretty good. At the bottom, we have a bar with abbreviations all the time. You can adjust what will be on it. We also have easy settings that are very logically grouped into different categories. It's good that most things can be fine-tuned here. You do not have to click through this uncomfortable menu on the clocks, so in general it is not a specially developed, modern system or something like that , but in such everyday use I have no major objections to it. There are a few buttons below the screen that are really well designed. Like a trifle, but it pleases. The air conditioning panel is a little less inspired, especially the dull circles here. Well, taking into account how big the buttons are here, ergonomically it is very good. The window control is located not as standard on the door, but next to the gear lever. The dimensions of the car are 357 cm long and 162 cm wide, so we are dealing here with a car that can easily fit in many places, e.g. in parking lots and is friendly in the city. If the City mode is activated, which makes the steering very light and allows for smooth maneuvering on the usual settings. For a city dweller, the steering wheel works a bit too hard, but this tuning works well at higher speeds, because then in the 500 the steering system has an unexpectedly adult character for such a small car and guarantees good predictability of driving. The suspension, being a bit more springy, also provides good stability, but overall the 500 is also not too hard and, as far as the short wheelbase allows, it offered the appropriate level of comfort, such as for more relaxed and normal driving, which the car encourages as a whole. The tested Fiat discourages fast driving due to dynamics and noise, exceeding 120 km / h even when driving empty is not particularly desirable here. There are no decorative light sources in the 500 cabin. The on-board instruments were highlighted in orange, which is less and less common nowadays, but taking into account the fact that the tested model made its debut on the market, this color was more popular then and in my opinion it still defends itself with good readability. the fact that it is pleasing to the eye with white on the clocks and on the central display. In general, I miss here some additional lighting elements, we are dealing with a designer model after all. Well, when it comes to readability and functionality, everything is ok here. As you can expect, the front lights in the tested Fiat have a round shape, the circles at the bottom are LED, in the headlights we have xenon, and the indicators have bulbs for a change. The side directions are on the fenders and also light bulb. The rear lighting is also based on this technology and it is a pity that despite the refreshing of the 500 the manufacturer has not introduced some more LEDs here. But aside from the outdated technology , the design of the lights itself is nice and fits this model. 500 is one of the few cars where you can still find xenon. They offer a cooler color of light than ordinary light bulbs, but not as cool as LEDs. In addition, by placing them in the lenses , you can count on good horizontal precision of cutting off the light and dark zones. The power of light is also around here. The Pilot 500 is in the form of a penknife. It is a bit too bulky for my taste, but because it is not heavy, and it is not very large in general, there is no problem with it anyway. It was made of very reasonable, rough plastic. The whole thing makes a solid impression. In turn, in terms of aesthetics, it already makes an average impression. In the upper parts of the dashboard, we have a hard plastic in the test car, which does not look too expensive. Fortunately, more attention here attracts the red insert, which looks really nice in terms of aesthetics. Unfortunately, this type of variety is not on the door. There is only a handle, which is interestingly designed. Besides, we have a very boring and hard space. The armrest is soft, but there is not much of this soft filling underneath it. In the lower parts of the cockpit, we have a continuation of hard materials. There is no piano black on the center tunnel of the center console, so I have no problems with some scratches of this type of thing. Some controls look worse, others a little better. This is what I have shown before. In general, I have no objections to them, as well as to their folding, as I have not heard any unwanted sounds, so the quality is decent here in my opinion. After such a small car, there is nothing to expect miracles. It is made of plastic, but nothing too stings the eyes. The Seaqual label means that the material on the seats, for example, comes from plastic bottles that were taken from the oceans and later processed so that they could be used in a car. By the way, this material here on the backrest has a pattern that is pleasing to the eye. We also have the logo of the 500. On the back, when I put the front seat under me and sit behind me, my knees touch the mentioned seat, but lightly enough that neither me nor the person traveling in front of me should be disturbed. Specifically, by straightening my hair, in turn, it touches the headlining, but again it is not such an intensity of contact that I have to suffer somehow, but it is enough to bend a little and it is ok. The middle tunnel is small in the 500, it should not really disturb anyone, because this model is officially only 4 seats. Even in the usual version of the tested model , the 185-liter luggage compartment is not impressive. It's even worse in the convertible. We also have a very small loading opening, so this space should definitely be treated in symbolic terms. There are no hooks or other practically other accessories on the sides of the trunk. In turn, under the floor, there is a repair kit and an element of the Beats audio system. To sum up, the Fiat 500 is a very specific car, which cannot be considered too much in common sense. But if someone is looking for a small car and can afford a bit of madness, then the test car in a convertible will surely provide a lot of fun to use and by its nature, I think it will appeal mainly to women. At the same time, I did not feel inappropriate driving this tiny Fiat. When thinking about it, however, it is worth remembering that structurally it is an old model and it cannot be masked in some areas. Well, if it does not bother someone, the car also works. And that's all I have prepared about a hundred without a roof. Thank you for your attention and I hope you enjoyed the test. If so, I encourage you to give this movie a thumbs up. I will be very pleased about that. If you are interested, I would like to remind you about CarLease Polska and their offer. If someone is not there, I also invite you to subscribe to the channel, because more materials on Wahacz TV will appear soon. See you."

J&#39;ai lou√© cette voiture 1 semaine en Sicile et effectu√© plus de 1000km avec (Ville et autoroute).<br>En positifs, j&#39;ai pu noter la dimension de la voiture, adapt√©e aux villes pour ne pas se prendre la t√™te.

Il est impossible de garder une vitesse constante, la voiture freine seule, c&#39;est dangereux et epuisant. Et bon courage pour les radars car si vous voulez rester √† 50, vous serez soit √† 40 soit √† 60, horrible.<br>Ce dernier point est r√©dhibitoire, je mets 1/5 √† cause de √ßa, ce qui est dommage car sans √ßa, c&#39;est une bonne petite voiture.', 'Je sais pas si tu la d√©j√† tester ou si tu la connais mais tu devrai tester absolument le fiat freemont j‚Äôen ai un et c‚Äôest une tueri', 'Pas tarbais mais lourdais...

Ca pourrait √™tre ma prochaine tellement je la trouve belle. Le moteur √† l&#39;air tres similaire au 4 cylindres et avec reprog et e85 √ßa doit etre tr√®s correct.

Bien vidang√© reguli√®rment, pas brutalis√© √† froid elle fonctionne impeccablement bien et aime les 6200-6300 tours par minute. On se met en troisieme √† 80-90 pour d√©passer et c&#39;est s√©curisant car assez exp√©ditif m√™me sans prendre d&#39;√©lan.

Le stage n&#39;augmente pas la puissance ou tr√©s peu mais la m√©canique est plus pleine et tient bien les cotes. La fiabilit√© est au rendez-vous. 1 an et quelques mois et 35000 km sans soucis. Les quelques soucis sont un roulement qui commence √† faire un petit peu de bruit et le stop et start qui se d√©clenche √† froid et que l&#39;on doit couper √† chaque fois que l&#39;on d√©marre. C&#39;est pas cool.', 'Super essai comme d&#39;ab. La ligne et l&#39;int√©rieur sont tr√®s sympas. Quant au moteur si tu veux plus tu prends l&#39;abarth qui doit √™tre tr√®s marrante √† conduire m√™me si la ligne se virilise un peu trop √† ton go√ªt.

Autos sind weltspitze, nicht ertragen. Warum? Weil da nichts dran ist. Ein Auto-Bl√∂d-Komplex, anerzogen, antrainiert. Hat aber mit der Wirklichkeit nichts zu tun. Nein, wir haben diverse Erfindungen und Neuerungen in den Jahrzehnten nicht allein zu verantworten. Nein, die Zeit von 78-85 war nicht nur bei Fiat/Lancia/Alfa die rostige Zeit, sondern bei Ford, Opel und VW genauso. Jeder Hersteller hatte mit bestimmten Modellen Quantenspr√ºnge in Qualit√§t und Verarbeitung vorzuweisen. Ich fahre aus Erfahrung und aufgrund meiner Vorliebe f√ºr Italien, eben 34 Jahre Fiat oder Alfa, das aus √úberzeugung. Momentan haben wir in der Familie 2 Gr. Punto, 1 Panda, 3 Tipo, 2 500X,  2 500L und einen 500 Cabrio. üòÖ', 'Mal was Neues, Autotester mit manik√ºrten Fingern√§geln....üòÖDiese H√§nde ber√ºhrten noch keinen hei√üen Auspuff, kein hei√ües Alt√∂l.....üòÇ', 'Das gleiche Motor mit Alfa Romeo Tonale sehr sparsam und zuverl√§ssige Motor und kr√§ftig 240Nm f√§hrt Prima', 'Bei dem Verbrauch w√ºrde ich doch lieber ein neuen Polo Benziner kaufen oder Ibiza', 'Bellissima üáÆüáπ‚ù§Ô∏è ich habe den 500 x Sport mit 150 PS ,,, der funktioniert Hammer ,,, Der beste Fiat momentan', 'Ich habe mir heute einen Gekauft in Blau', 'Alles Toll, w√ºrde mich gerne aber mit dir ueber Italien .unterhalten..leider kommen immer die gleichen bl√∂den negativen Klischees‚Ä¶schade.. sch√∂n das du/Ihr die italienische Autos gerne vorstellt‚Ä¶aber haltet euch an die Realit√§t.. diese Art italiener zu beschreiben ist nicht gerade freundlich und nicht realistisch (zB wir definieren uns nie ueber die spaghetti ) sondern eher abwertend.. ich kann dir als italiener raten vielleicht die Italiener besser kennenzulernen!', 'Hallo Jessi und Jan, da habt ihr wieder einen tollen Test geliefert; herzlichen Dank. FIAT steht heutzutage fuer Innovation, Qualitaet und Lifestyl, nicht zu vergleichen mit den Deutschen Norm Karossen. Hoffentlich bringt ihr noch viele solche spassige und informative Tests. Dem Jan seine Sprueche finde ich super...!!', 'Danke f√ºr das Video, ihr seid wie immer SPITZE. Bez√ºglich Gr√∂√üe vom Display usw. m√∂chte ich einfach anmerken, dass weniger oft mehr ist<br>und ich denke, dass dieses Auto  (nicht nur) f√ºr &quot;Schn√§ppchenj√§ger&quot; sehr interessant sein k√∂nnte.<br>Es ist ja alles da was man braucht. Weniger ist vielleicht manchmal mehr?<br>Naja, dass muss halt jeder selbst entscheiden.<br>Danke und liebe Gr√º√üe aus Ober√∂sterreich üòÄ', 'In den alten 500er in den 60ern ging ne Familie mit 8 Kindern mit Eis in Napoli locker rein!

Eine typische Fiat-Plastikkiste.

Jeder unperfekte Fiat (von Lancia und Alfa nicht zu reden) hat mehr Emotion und Style als die perfekten, aber meist seelenarmen Deutschen. Mein Motto seit drei Jahrzehnten. Der als Capri Yachtclub w√§re meiner. Mach ich vielleicht auch noch. Danke, ihr habt den Spirit einfach getroffen...', 'Was ich an den Italienischen Italienern liebe ist das sie wieder nicht an der WM teilnehmen..<br><br>Dolce Vita f√ºr&#39;n Arsch<br><br>Mit dem Arsch uff der Couch<br><br>Tsch√ºss', 'Zwei Frauen, zwei M√§nner oder beides find ich ne gute Aussage mal ü§™', 'Ach du schei√üe, den Wagen gibts immer noch. <br>In Deutschland: der Wagen ist nach sieben Jahren zu alt und kann weg, bekommt nen Nachfolger. <br>In Italien: Der ist gerade mal  8 Jahre alt, da reicht das gef√ºhlt 12 Facelift und der Bock l√§uft nochmal 10 Jahre vom Band.üòÇ<br>Egal, wirklich konkurrenzf√§hig waren die Fiats ja nie (au√üer 500e), daf√ºr halt billig. <br>Abgesehen davon find ich es sehr gut, dass Vollhybride keine F√∂rderung bekommen. Steuergelder daf√ºr zu verwenden, dass der Wagen ein paar Kilometer elektrisch f√§hrt, w√§re schlicht nicht tragbar.', 'Hallo Jessi und Jan, sch√∂nes Auto und es sind vor allem wieder Design und Emotionen, die bestechen. Das hat Fiat einfach drauf, wie bei meinen beiden Cinquecento. Was die aufgerufenen Preise anbelangt, so orientiere ich mich immer noch an Halb- und Jahreswagen sowie Lagerfahrzeugen. Ich habe bei beiden 500 jeweils 42% Nachlass erzielt und das w√§re auch beim 500x definitiv &#39;ein Wort!&#39; Mit Dank f√ºr die Vorstellung, lG Michael ü§ìüëç', '28.800 ‚Ç¨‚Ä¶ mamamia wenn es doch nur der Preis in Lire w√§re', 'Charmante Hartplastik verpackt im guten Design.

Proprio sabato notte ho fatto il tagliando; purtroppo non ho il ponte ma con ottimi cavalletti sono riuscito. Il pannello sotto √® parecchio grande e come hai detto hanno messo 8 viti.. Praticamente un antifurto pi√π che un fissaggio. Il filtro olio effettivamente √® tirato a morte. Ho tre tipi di chiavi per il serraggio e lo smontaggio, quella a bicchiere pu√≤ essere usata senza ricorrere a quella a ragno con tre fermi o quella a nastro in acciaio, PERO&#39; serve avere una mano forte per distributire la trazione del bicchiere su tutta la superficie esterna del filtro. Filtro abitacolo scomodo ( parlo sempre di panda ) sarebbe meglio smontare il portaoggetti anche se si riesce, Attenzione all&#39;air flow, deve essere corretta altrimenti si intasa in fretta. Per il filtro aria motore ho notato che viene parecchio &quot;strozzato&quot; sia nella presa dell&#39;aria esterna , che recupera su un lato. All&#39;uopo ho preso un vecchio filtro da demolire e ne ho realizzato uno con una rete in alluminio e il &quot;red sponge&quot; della malossi. Sempre rispettando il corretto flusso aria. L&#39;auto ha cambiato musica ed anche prestazioni. Lasciando l&#39;air box originale , la presa dell&#39;aria avviene sempre da davanti dove l&#39;aria rimane pi√π fresca. Questo elemento di filtraggio necessita di una pulizia pi√π sovente ed accurata. ma le prestazioni giustificano il piccolo impegno. Nel mio caso essendo piuttosto alto , ho adottato il &quot;distanziale per volante&quot; . Da una sensazione di guida molto piacevole.

L&#39;attenzione √® quella di cambiare ogni tanto la posizione della parte in gomma che tocca il vetro: se ci si fa caso la parte a contatto con il vetro riposa sempre nella stessa posizione, che √® quella in cui arriva nell&#39;ultima spazzolata che le si fa fare. Se ogni tanto ci ricordiamo di cambiarle il senso ( basta spingere appena la spazzola in gi√π - come se facesse un altro cm di corsa - e lasciare che la gomma si assesti nel senso opposto). Cos√¨ facendo si eviter√† che si ingottisce e quando la andremo ad utilizzare far√† quel rumoraccio che ben conosciamo, saltando sul vetro senza portare via l&#39;acqua.

Quello che manca in quest‚Äôauto sono le maniglie del passeggero e del guidatore e anche dietro. Sono fondamentali sia per le persone anziane o in alcuni casi per problemi di salita. Un copri moquette incluso per il bagagliaio sarebbe utile visto il costo e un ricambio di tappetino di scorta in moquette. Apprezzo i cerchi molto sportivi magari con qualche wrap rosso sul nero sarebbero accattivanti. Lo spoiler in tinta e le calandre sono accattivanti e lineari allo stile della carrozzeria nel suo complesso. La frizione lunga e che non √© ad iniezione mi √© dispiaciuta per via di un mio personale gusto a dover sentire fisicamente la frizione nel mio stile di guida. Molto bello l‚Äôinfotaimed nuovo e brioso. Peccato per gli assistenti alla guida cosa fondamentale nella guida cittadina visto la poca attenzione della gente per strada. Soprattutto per un neopatentato. Peccato per la mancanza di una retrocamera che √© sempre utile per le persone di una certa et√† o nel caso si rompano i sensori posteriori. Bello lo scarico e silenzioso. Un po‚Äô meno apprezzabile la rumorosit√† dell‚Äôabitacolo e la poca robustezza delle porte. Questo lo dico perch√© possiedo un auto molto anziana ma di grande qualit√†. Purtroppo ora come ora poche si salvano ma nel complesso se dovrei dire se acquistare questo o il modello precedente sceglierei questo sia allestimento sport che Lounge ovvero con i sedili scozzesi molto molto carini. Altra osservazione peccato per gli interni bianchi e le plastiche poco massicce rendono a rovinarsi nel tempo se non trattati con opportuni lavaggi.

Ich habe mich f√ºr den Fiat 500e Icon entschieden. Er hat mich zuallererst vom Design √ºberzeugt. Das Auto gef√§llt jedem und ist ein echter Sympathietr√§ger. Nach Bestellung vergingen keine drei Monate bis ich den Wagen hatte. Um es auf den Punkt zu bringen: Ich bin mehr als zufrieden und ich w√ºrde mir den 500e sofort wieder kaufen. Vor allem die Bedienerfreundlichkeit, relativ kurze Ladezeiten und das tadellose Apple CarPlay √ºberzeugen total. Muss nat√ºrlich dazu sagen, dass ich zu 80 % alleine unterwegs bin, zu 20 % zu zweit.

Kein anderes Auto bildet f√ºr mich soviel Emotionen.', 'Perfektes Stadtauto mit Potential f√ºr mehr. In der Stadt fahre ich den Akku eh¬¥ nicht leer und er kann √ºber Nacht immer wieder (langsam und schonend) aufgeladen werden.

So klein ist der √ºbrigens gar nicht. Sind damit zu dritt auch schon 10 Tage in den Urlaub gefahren.

La sto usando da 4 giorni di hybrid su questa macchina c‚Äô√® solo la scritta !!', 'Quanto consuma in autostrada a 130 km/h in 6^marcia?', 'bellissima e tutto, ma io mi chiedo in generale, fanno un sacco di guide e test in cui si dimostra di non lasciare il wifi del cellulare acceso che emana un botto di radiazioni ed √® ormai scientificamente provate che distrugge le cellule celebrali e diminuisce memoria e logica ci rincoglionisce insomma e di metterlo sotto carica in modali√† aeroplano in una stanza lontana della camera da letto, e poi fanno le auto hybrid con la batteria sotto il culo.... mi piacerebbe che qualcuno testi le radiazioni e l&#39;elettro magnetismo che c&#39;√® su quel sedile. beato 1.2 fire indistruttibile che facevano 400 450 mila km con solo olio e filtro, parlando ieri con meccanici fiat mi dicevano appunto questo che per ora non siamo minimamente nemmeno lontani con questo motore all&#39;affidabilit√† che aveva il 1.2 che deriva dal 900 fire poi 1000 poi 12 e 14 e fino all ultimo modificato e continuamente migliorato perfino con trattamenti anti attrito silenziosissimo zero vibrazioni etc. addirittura piu volte arrivato in officina stellantis con la stelvio ho visto piu di una volta questo motore su panda che mangiava tanto olio e lo hanno smontato piu volte mi diceva il proprietario senza capire e risolvere.', 'Sto guidando da oltre un mese una 500 hybrid presa a noleggio. Devo ammettere che mi piace non poco, sopratutto il rombo del motore quando sale di giri. Ogni tanto, in condizioni di totale sicurezza stradale, senza alcun&#39;altra vettura vicina e su tratti stradali comunque deserti, la sforzo in accelerazioni violente facendo sgommare le ruote brutalmente portandola fino ai 6.000 giri dove poi interviene il limitatore che taglia bruscamentela potenza. All&#39;inizio non mi piaceva molto quel tunnel centrale di plastica dove √® posizionata la leva del cambio essendo troppo largo e quindi scomodo per le ginocchia; successivamente mi sono abituato. La 500 la trovo certamente &quot;simpatica&quot;, &quot;sbarazzina&quot;, abbastanza vivace, relativamente divertente e poco impegnativa ancorch√© sia abituato a ben altro livello e piacere di guida come quelli della Giulietta turbo benzina GPL 120 cv. Ho guidato entrambe le versioni della 500; quella col tachimetro e contagiri con le (punte delle) lancette arancioni che in verit√† non mi piacciono affatto in quanto non di immediata lettura e quella col tachimetro col numero della<br> velocit√† digitale in bianco molto ben visibile che preferisco senz&#39;altro alla prima. Nel complesso una buona city car con velleit√† per uscite anche fuori porta per non lunghi viaggi ma con una unica pecca derivante dal costo abbastanza elevato che FIAT ormai richiede per il suo acquisto.', 'Da possessore dello stesso identico modello, ma con motorizzazione Fire 1.2 (5 marce manuale) posso dire che il cambio a 6 marce sia un&#39;ottima aggiunta. La batteria l&#39;avrei messa sul lato passeggero per ottimizzare i pesi, oppure divisa sotto entrambi i sedili, ma naturalmente si √® cercato di ridurre i costi. Quello che mi lascia perplesso √® che lato accessori non √® cambiato assolutamente nulla rispetto alla mia che √® del 2019 (modello S che nasce nel 2016).<br>Bellissima Firenze!!', 'A me hanno detto che il tre cilindri non √®  cos√¨ un granch√©  soprattutto per i consumi', 'Ciao Fiore, dopo ti chiamo, non ti preoccupare', 'Ci vorrebbe un doppia frizione per una vettura di questo tipo.', 'Macchina molto bella, ma il motore √® un polmone ! Inutile dire che in 4 marcia sale , si ok ma √® lenta , i veri motori che spingevano erano i 1.3 multijet !', 'Ho visto che hai messo la 5 marcia ai 45kmh...il motore √® elastico?', 'Interessante ed originale video; una domanda: il climatizzatore era acceso? Oppure quando lo si accende che succede a ripresa, velocit√†, prestazioni? Grazie in anticipo per l&#39;eventuale risposta', 'Ma pensavo peggio dai ci sta come consumi mi piace üòâ', 'Bellissima auto la tiene un mio amico, scattante e tecnologica con quei due schermi interni dove si pu√≤ anche mettere il navigatore. Comoda anche per fare lunghi viaggi in due.', 'Arrivata martedi,ma ritirata mercoledi ü§ü.Dolcevita ,tt ok con tetto elettrico ,unico neo che sotto il cofano antetiore manca il colore in tanti spazii ...insomma ,e lo stemma fiat nn √© proprio diritto al pelo', 'ho preso la 500 Cabrio Hybrid sport di colore rosso il 27 giugno 22. Ora ha 1650km.  ho fatto due viaggi in autostrada e il resto in citt√†. dopo 1000k m si √® svegliata e il motore √® veramente vivace e piacevole (tenete a mente che prima avevo una Alfa 147Q2 con 150 cv. Ottima in citt√† e subito fuori ma anche in autostrada. La versione sport in quanto top di gamma ha davvero moltissime cose, alla mia mancano i sensori pioggia e crepuscolare purtroppo, ma l&#39;ho presa come arrivava se no dovevo aspettare mesi. Ho fatto Cuneo - Bordighera e ritorno, circa 480 Km con solo 22 litri, misurati alla pompa: partenza con pieno e ritorno subito il pieno. ergo circa 22 litri con una media di 110 ma molti sorpassi. all&#39;andata eravamo in 3 pi√π bagagliaio pieno ( tra l&#39;altro 1 valigia grande, un trolley e una grossa borsa frigo con ancora un po&#39; di spazio per uno zainetto; ritorno solo ma con guida pi√π sportiva. Io sono soddisfatto; era l&#39;auto che volevo, ora che la uso per lo pi√π in citt√† e con pochi km annui. Piccoli costi di assicurazione, bollo esente per 5 anni, consumi ridotti. I difetti per me sono: mancanza di appoggiabraccio centrale risolta con aftermarket; ruote 195/45 R16 che consumano di pi√π e quelli da 185/55 R15 andavano pi√π che bene, mancanza dei sensori posteggio anteriori, Alzacristallo sinistro che non sale automaticamente e non si apre/chiude con il telecomando.', 'dopo qualche mese a quanto si attestano i consumi?', 'Ma la retromarcia nella 500 si inserisce alzando il pomello del cambio vero? Una sorta di sicura', 'Bellissimo video! La consiglieresti a un neopatentato?', 'Preso una Connect colore nera. Mi mancano solo un po&#39; di guide e poi la potr√≤ guidare ü§§.', 'I love the fiat 500 I am undecided for the sport version or the red trim üòçüòç', 'Come allestimenti interni (cruscotto, comandi ed estetica) direi che sembra una versione lusso. Favolosa Ormai, credo sia riduttivo chiamare queste vetture &quot;utilitarie&quot;, perch√® hanno prestazioni e confort degne delle macchine pi√π lussuose. L&#39;unica cosa, magari per chi √® alto di statura, potrebbe essere che si stia un po&#39; sacrificati come gambe, soprattutto il conducente.']","['2024-06-06T22:01:21Z', '2024-03-08T22:41:38Z', '2024-03-02T08:10:44Z', '2023-11-27T06:40:03Z', '2023-05-14T21:14:26Z', '2023-03-26T12:44:50Z', '2023-03-11T01:39:56Z', '2022-12-16T07:40:21Z', '2022-11-29T01:04:32Z', '2022-11-28T21:47:50Z', '2022-11-24T21:16:41Z', '2022-11-14T14:05:50Z', '2022-11-10T11:36:43Z', '2022-10-15T07:55:18Z', '2022-10-08T13:09:23Z', '2022-09-29T13:12:04Z', '2022-08-27T09:09:03Z', '2022-08-16T20:00:05Z', '2022-08-14T21:38:00Z', '2022-08-13T14:07:11Z', '2022-07-30T22:45:15Z']","Transcript not available:

Und maximal 140 kmh auf er Autobahn ist Steinzeit. Also &quot;reines&quot; Stadtauto, hat auf langen Strecken nichts zu suchen. Wir hatten vor Jahren einen 1.4L Fiat 500 und der war perfekt 100ps und der verbrauch lag auch bei 5.5 - 6 Litern, das Ding hatte beschleugigung, sparsamkeit, sound, alles.

Schlechte Fahrleistungen, hoher Verbrauch (6l) , falsche CO2-Angaben von Fiat. Statt 89gCO2 auf der Fiat-Homepage stehen in den Papieren 119gCO2. Hybrid ist ein Witz, v√∂llig nutzlos. Riesiger Wendekreis, trotz Lounge-Version schlechte Ausstattung. Wir sind froh, wenn wir ihn in 18 Monaten zur√ºckgeben k√∂nnen.', 'Ich habe mir den Fiat 500 Hybrid gekauft und muss sagen ein realistischer Verbrauch ist im Sommer 5,4 L und im Winter 6 L. Was man aber nicht vergessen darf ist, dass dieses Auto nur Sinn macht wenn man wirklich viel in der Stadt unterwegs ist.', 'Geiles und schickes Hybrid Auto!<br><br>Top Test üëåüëåüëå‚ùó', 'Die B√ºchse kannst auch du nicht sch√∂n labern, bei aller M√ºhe! Also Fakt, teurer Spa√ü ohne Benefit f√ºr den Verbraucher, oder? 7 Liter auf der Uhr mit einem Dreizylinder und elektrischer Unterst√ºtzung, klingt echt beschissen.', 'Wir haben uns gestern einen Neuen gekauft.. Bekommen ihn n√§chste Woche und freuen uns schon sehr. Farbe ist auch Tau Gr√ºn ! VG', 'Mildhybrid?! So ein Quatsch...', 'Es ist nicht notwendig die City Funktion auszuschalten auf der Autobahn, da diese nur bis 35 km/h aktiv ist.', 'Find das Auto cool. Den Mildhybrid Faktor seh ich nicht.. viel Aufwand f√ºr die paar hunderstel die gespart werden. Ein √úbergang zum Elektroauto. Hoffe die elektrisieren den richtig gut. Viele Gr√º√üe &amp; weiter so!

shops primark and this is for like an optican store but i put all the things inside it's ripped ignore that i need to show you everything that i got and i'm literally so obsessed my car now is having glow up and i decided to do the glow up but the name of my car i don't know if you know it but i think you know it if you have me on instagram her name is snowy because she's white and snow so her name is snowy like when i bought her like my dad when he bought her uh we both like oh she's so clean like she's so white she's like a snow so automatically her name was snowy so easy it was meant to be it was meant for her so that's her name very started by the way to show you what i got from aliexpress and all the whole don't forget to subscribe and keep up with my social media for more updates like daily updates and subscribe to my youtube channel so i'm gonna do also a tick tock video about my car so don't forget to find the video also on my tick tock if you want to see more about my car yesterday she had her bath and on monday she's gonna go for service that was something that is really obvious and i think you saw it already and it's the one and only car steering wheel so it's the rhinestone steering wheel you have no idea how blinky it is and i will have a video just for this so you can see how blinky it is and i cannot wait to drive my fiat is beige so it's kind of matching with the steering wheel i love it it looks so nice and cute and guys believe it or not it smells like leather and it's from aliexpress and now let's move on to the blinky angry the smaller parts i have a lot of things inside like you see this tiny bag but it's full of accessories of snowy so let's start so first of all i got this phone holder i also have pictures because the lighting now is not that good and you can really see that blinky that this is very blinky like everything i got is very blinky i got this phone holder because she needs that you know next i got these uh hungers that are for handbags you know if you're a girl of course you know how annoying is to throw your back at the back and you can't really have access to it so these are hangers and you can put it behind your seat and you have easy access to your bag two of them these are for you know the cups to put your caps in your car to have your drink just to blink it a little bit because we love bling and i'm sure you know all of you know these they're the most famous things to put in your car they're like the star buttons like rhinestones and i got one two three four five then i got this one that i have no idea how is it called in english you will see thing is this a mini chanel perfume that you put on your air conditioning and then inside you can apply inside there's a space to put capsules and i got two packages with different different smells there's lemon peach strawberry um berries a lot of things and i got two packages to refill and you know when the air from the air condition came out the smells come out as well so this is my line for your car also i got this extra rhinestone tape because i want to customize the fiat loco there are no steering wheel logos for fiats explain me why is that happening but i can't i couldn't find anywhere so i was like you know i'm gonna do it myself and then all the leftovers i don't know i'm gonna customize my car inside and then i got my name these are my name initials i got my whole name anastasia like a n a s t a f i a anastasia full name to put it at the back of my car outside because i need to put my name on everything two last things that i need to put in my car this is something very important so when you have an accident please know but when maybe you have an accident and you're trapped in your car this helps you to break the window and also cut the seat belt you can escape i think this is very important for everyone to have and then i have this case that they're like card games and i want to put it in my car because me and my friends when we go to the coffee shops we always like to play card games and i need to put in my card because i think i need to have everyday access on them so this is what i got for snowy and i cannot wait to decorate here i'm so excited guys and i will bring you with me because that video i was gonna do it like one year ago maybe more years ago but here where i live in cyprus so difficult to order car accessories so i had to go to study in the uk and order it from there and bring it to cyprus so yeah this is what i did because cyprus to order that there's like this thing is like 10 euro and you paid 60 euros shipping like i don't know why so that was a hole and see you when i'm gone we're trying to put the steering wheel cover come on baby you can do it we did it so glittery and i love the color it's not that bad is it bad actually no it's nice it fits the car yeah glitter is snowy here and this is the phone holder and i love it actually it's so easy to put like it's just this and it's so stable so it's not moving i like it and it can fit any phone like it's adjustable so nice matching with steering wheel cover this is so cute oh my god i love everything is coming all together and and the smells are lavender we have peach we have tropical we have platinum shower so this is gonna smell fresh car this is lemon and also there's one jasmine baby shall we put the jasmine okay so cute and you just put it so good oh my god it actually does yeah wow and there comes out and it smells jasmine and also we i have all these leftovers so for these that's gonna i'm gonna put it there how [Music] they are glittery they're a little bit big but they fit okay and also at the back logo now the car local as i told you i couldn't find anywhere the fiat logo so i'm gonna diy so i'm trying now to cut it with this mini scissor and there's glue at the back slowly slowly stick it like so that one i diy and it came out pretty good to be honest but i love it everything is so glittery they turn out so freaking good they're so freaking glittery this smells so nice and i have a lot of refills to do this is so stable it's 100 worth it uh i love this they really bring out my car this is so good for the crab also here the 500 with glitter so now i'm cutting for the 500 show it baby i did the um did the upper side and now i'm doing the lower side and i need to see if this is enough it's going to be like that and like that and i have so much left i can do anything i want in my car literally i can customize anything even these look nice no that's too much too much i know i'm not gonna do it okay so now i'm gonna take that the tape off okay and i'm just gonna hold it like that i'm just gonna take all the tape off get right here and then slowly i

shops primark and this is for like an optican store but i put all the things inside it's ripped ignore that i need to show you everything that i got and i'm literally so obsessed my car now is having glow up and i decided to do the glow up but the name of my car i don't know if you know it but i think you know it if you have me on instagram her name is snowy because she's white and snow so her name is snowy like when i bought her like my dad when he bought her uh we both like oh she's so clean like she's so white she's like a snow so automatically her name was snowy so easy it was meant to be it was meant for her so that's her name very started by the way to show you what i got from aliexpress and all the whole don't forget to subscribe and keep up with my social media for more updates

yesterday she had her bath and on monday she's gonna go for service that was something that is really obvious and i think you saw it already and it's the one and only car steering wheel so it's the rhinestone steering wheel you have no idea how blinky it is and i will have a video just for this so you can see how blinky it is and i cannot wait to drive my fiat is beige so it's kind of matching with the steering wheel i love it it looks so nice and cute and guys believe it or not it smells like leather and it's from aliexpress and now let's move on to the blinky angry the smaller parts i have a lot of things inside like you see this tiny bag but it's full of accessories of snowy so let's start so first of all i got this phone holder i also have pictures because the lighting now is not that good and you can really see that blinky that this is very blinky like everything i got is very blinky i got this phone holder because she needs that you know next i got these uh hungers that are for handbags you know if you're a girl of course you know how annoying is to throw your back at the back and you can't really have access to it so these are hangers and you can put it behind your seat and you have easy access to your bag two of them these are for you know the cups to put your caps in your car to have your drink just to blink it a little bit because we love bling and i'm sure you

packages with different different smells there's lemon peach strawberry um berries a lot of things and i got two packages to refill and you know when the air from the air condition came out the smells come out as well so this is my line for your car also i got this extra rhinestone tape because i want to customize the fiat loco there are no steering wheel logos for fiats explain me why is that happening but i can't i couldn't find anywhere so i was like you know i'm gonna do it myself and then all the leftovers i don't know i'm gonna customize my car inside and then i got my name these are

need to put in my car this is something very important so when you have an accident please know but when maybe you have an accident and you're trapped in your car this helps you to break the window and also cut the seat belt you can escape i think this is very important for everyone to have and then i have this case that they're like card games and i want to put it in my car because me and my friends when we go to the coffee shops we always like to play card games and i need to put in my card because i think i need to have everyday access on them so this is what i got for snowy and i cannot wait to decorate here i'm so excited guys and i will bring you with me because that video i was gonna do it like one year ago maybe more years ago but here where i live in cyprus so difficult to order car accessories so i had to go to study in the uk and order it from there and bring it to cyprus so yeah this is what i did because cyprus to order that there's like this thing is like 10 euro and you paid 60 euros shipping like i don't know why so that was a hole and see you when i'm gone we're trying to put the steering wheel cover come on baby you can do it we did it so glittery and i love the color it's not that bad is it bad actually no it's nice it fits the car yeah glitter is snowy here and this is the phone holder and i love it actually it's so easy to put like it's just this and it's so stable so it's not moving i like it and it can fit any phone like it's adjustable so nice matching with steering wheel cover this is so cute oh my god i love everything is coming all together and and the smells are lavender we have peach we have tropical we have platinum shower so this is gonna smell fresh car this is lemon and also there's one jasmine baby shall we put the jasmine okay so cute and you just put it so good oh my god it actually does yeah wow and there comes out and it smells jasmine and also we i have all these leftovers so for these that's gonna i'm gonna put it there how [Music] they are glittery they're a little bit big but they fit okay and also at the back logo now the car local as i told you i couldn't find anywhere the fiat logo so i'm gonna diy so i'm trying now to cut it with this mini scissor and there's glue at the back slowly slowly stick it like so that one i diy and it came out pretty good to be honest but i love it everything is so glittery they turn out so freaking good they're so freaking glittery this smells so nice and i have a lot of refills to do this is so stable it's 100 worth it uh i love this they really bring out my car this is so good for the crab also here the 500 with glitter so now i'm cutting for the 500 show it baby i did the um did the upper side and now i'm doing the lower side and i need to see if this is enough it's going to be like that and like that and i have so much left i can do anything i want in my car literally i can customize anything even these look nice no that's too much too much i know i'm not gonna do it okay so now i'm gonna take that the tape off okay and i'm just gonna hold it like that i'm just gonna take all the tape off get right here and then slowly i

and welcome to a new video You join me in the new Fiat 500X And now I'll show you this car's infotainment system This Uconnect system is not only mounted on the 500X or just Fiat cars But also, let's say, on Alfa Romeo, so with this video you'll know about this system on many FCA cars The new Alfa Romeo Giulia, the Ferraris and the Maserati don't mount this system They have different infotainment systems But let's focus on Uconnect This car has the 7'' screen Let's see it In a time where you get with huge-tablet-like car displays, with very slim frames Fiat chose some big chunky frames And four buttons around it, one for the Mute One for adjusting the volume and for turning on and off the system One for browsing your lists, for example the radio stations And the one for night mode, to turn off just the display Now The system shows 7 main pages First one is the radio, with all its presets With that button we can browse stations, here you can select DAB, FM And if we press for some seconds up here You put the current radio station in the memory A useful feature I found, but this one is a bit difficult to reach from the driver's position Is the Maps button: without getting out of the radio, I can see my current position on the little map Let's see media I connected my phone with the Uconnect I plugged it in with a USB cable, I can use bluetooth Here we can see the various connections: 2 USB sockets, Bluetooth and AUX IN For example, let's try Apple Music I try and press on Maps Under that, there's the info button, with all the informations about artist and song played Of course I can adjust many details of the audio Equalizer, fader I can choose the main speaker from which I want to listen music, right now, the one on my left With the Equalizer I can adjust High, Medium and Bass We can automatically adjust the volume with the speed of the car, increasing it with the speed And then other settings Talking about navigation Not every Fiat has the navi, this one does so I'll show you And it's based on TomTom system, one of the best We have 4 buttons Search, and a little keyboard appears My positions, with your usual destinations Then the TomTom map Service stations, different points of interest You also get the day mode And then there are the voice controls As I said before, the screen is a bit far from the driver's position, so voice control is very useful You have a button on the steering wheel, and this window appears on the screen You just have to learn these few key phrases and you'll be able to set addresses, make phone calls I find this kind of systems very useful In the middle there's Uconnect button, but you have to wait for it, let's click on phone First off you can select on Do Not Disturb, with the option to send an automatic SMS Down here you get the phone book, the actual phone book from your phone I can manually compose the number You can call the last phone number you called Then, in the settings, we can select the ''Do not disturb'' SMS text And we can also combine the different bluetooth connected devices ''Disconnect phone'' ''Set as default'' ''Audio devices'' and so on Talking about the settings You can select the driving assistance systems The Lane Control warning The intensity of Lane Control, the Park Assist The Parking Sensors volume, the Rain Sensors So many different options This car has the automatic parking brake, and right here you can enable it or disable it Then the lights settings You can customize many different settings of this car The last page is the trip, classic trip page with informations Average consumptions, average speed, distance But the most important thing of this system is the Uconnect Uconnect totally connects with your phone So we can get all of the infos, like the media, or the fuel level in the car Displayed on the phone So first off let's see the Uconnect on the car And then I'll show you the phone app First of all there's Uconnect Live The first button, with the smiling face, is the Eco Drive There are usual trip infos but also useful suggestions for a more Eco driving style There's Reuters With many different news Pressing this button you can listen to the news There's Tune In, for listening to web radios Then there's My Car, one of the most important apps for the drivers It shows the distance or the days to your next car check Then it gives you also the full instructions about different indicators So it shows all of the different warning and indicator lights and also how to solve those problems Then there's Deezer Is a music app like Spotify and so on So it's a streaming app FCA has a collaboration with Deezer, so you can use your account straight in the car Then there are Twitter and Facebook Of course it doesn't show you the feed But when you click, for example, on this ''Facebook - Check in'' button It automatically posts your location on Facebook The into Uconnect we get again the radio Also settings for media, phone and audio, things we just saw On this other page it shows all of the apps I just mentioned, Eco Drive, Deezer and so on And then in the last page, not available on this car, on an Abarth you can do it The Abarth Telemetry, with all of the tracks loaded into the infotainment system Now let's check out the phone app Here's the Uconnect app First of all your garage: if you have different FCA cars with the Uconnect, they'll appear here On services we get My Car, as I mentioned before Right now the app is connected to the car First of all, opening the map, I can see where I parked the car Then I can check if there are any warning lights I can check out the battery level and the fuel level Very important informations for every driver Then Eco Drive, where the app shows you how you drove in your last trip I don't want to login right now And then there's TomTom It's a live service, useful for traffic and other informations like that If you don't know how to use this, there's even the Tutorial page As you can see many informations, the cure of your vehicle Check out your car's position Even asking for assistance in case of accident or theft These are all online services Even if you're not inside the car For example, you need to repair the car The app finds the closest repair shop and sends the indications to the navi of the car Well, this was Uconnect I find it very useful mostly for

It measures just over three meters long and barely reaches a meter and a half high. And while it's not quite as small as the original model from the 1950s, this modern model claims to be among the smallest cars on the market. Fun fact: Did you know that in 2022 they manufactured 62 units of defective Fiat 500 Dolcevita that caused the car to catch fire? It was discovered that during rapid acceleration or braking it caused a short circuit in the electrical connection that caused the fire. But the company managed to pull them off the market without a hitch. This retro-style car is designed to move around the city since its consumption is very low, it is very agile and has a perfect turning radius to move through small spaces and park without problems in any space. With a hybrid gasoline engine of 1000 cubic cylinders that yields 70 horsepower... it spends close to 4 liters per 100 km. Is it worth having this car? What do you think?"

Mais je voulais confirmer. Le 5008 est top mais plus de coffre avec les deux si√®ges dans le coffre. J&#39;avais le 5008 car 3 enfants et mon amie avais 1 fille. Mais je m&#39;en suis s√©par√©. Vu que je suis seul avec mes enfants maintenant. Et j&#39;ai pris un C5 grand coffre, mais que 5 place. Je trouve que quand on a des enfants, c&#39;est important d&#39;avoir un grand coffre. Par contre les grosses voitures, j&#39;arrive mieux √† les conduire et √† me garer. Avec une petite voiture, j&#39;ai plus de mal.

Arriv√©e au garage j&#39;avais vu une twingo mais  mon mari m&#39;en a  dissuad√© car nous venions juste  d&#39;avoir une petite fille et la prochaine n&#39;allait pas tarder √† pointer son bout de nez. Aussi en ouvrant le coffre  impossible de mettre une poussette  et  autre chose.  Quand au si√®ge auto devant √ßa passe mais avec 3 petits enfants non, aussi nous avons opt√© pour une capture  qui est plus grande et haute . Dans le  coffre, je peux mettre la  poussette et  des courses ou encore ma servante de couture et ma machine √† coudre. Et j&#39;ai de la place pour mes 3 petits enfants avec 2 si√®ges auto ( elles ont maintenant  3 et 4 ans) √† l&#39;arri√®re et nono vient  d&#39;avoir 10 ans de temps en temps il est au milieu des filles sinon devant. <br>La seule chose que je regrette c&#39;est le coffre de la  laguna tu pouvais mettre 6 valises √†  l&#39;int√©rieur. Dans la  capture  3 a4 sacs  remplis de courses üòÖ. Je ne conduit pas la 508 break de mon mari car elle est trop longue  pour moi. Alors que j&#39;ai appris √† conduire avec le Laguna  qui √©tait tr√®s grande..j&#39;aime beaucoup Renault comme marque pour moi mon mari a une Peugeot et quand nous √©tions jeunes nous avions une fiat. Mais je devais reprendre une voiture pour moi √ßa serait  soit une  mini  soit une  coccinelle ( malheureusement ils n&#39;en font plus) .<br>Voil√† mon avis. <br>Bisous √† tous', 'Coucou y aura t&#39;il encore des vid√©o organisation avant la rentr√©e car √ßa motive grave üòä', 'Coucou, le syst√®me coffre de toit est bien pratique‚Ä¶bonnes vacances , reposez-vous bien et surtout profitez‚Ä¶profitez !‚ù§<br>Roooo Ines tient d√©j√† un livre c‚Äôest dingue comment elle est √©veill√©e.
