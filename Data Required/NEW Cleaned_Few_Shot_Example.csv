Users appreciate its retro looks, smooth ride, and decent fuel efficiency. However, common criticisms include limited battery range in the electric model, uncomfortable seats for long drives, small trunk space, engine noise at higher speeds, lack of advanced safety features, and cramped cabin for taller individuals. Overall, it’s considered a good car for short commutes and city use, but with room for improvement in comfort and features."

it seemed that with the catalytic converter we would solve the pollution problem now hybrids we continue to spend more are only palliatives the real solution is to reduce the population
hello everyone, I have owned an oo sport hybrid since December, let me make a few considerations: I take Fiat with the always new formula, and therefore a long-term rental, this is my third year always with the sport version, and the first two with cv engines, so I can make a comparison on fuel consumption and everything else, I use the car mainly to go to work, making two trips a day, so a daily total of km. I took it because I wanted to try out this new engine with the same equipment as past cars, it cost me eurini less and was supposed to give me about a mile more with a litre because I said to myself, I've got to change it, let's try it out. Well, let's talk about the hybrid now, I'm just finishing up my first full tank of fuel, and as of today, I'm still on the first full tank of fuel, and I'm very disappointed. The problem is the electrical system, the bsg belt integrated starter generator, a volt generator applied directly to the engine, which allows you to recover energy during braking and deceleration and store it in a lithium-ion battery that works when it wants to. degrees and everything starts up, so start amp stop active the system allows energy recovery braking deceleration and the heat engine shuts down even when running below km h I leave the office at at degrees and nothing is activated but the heat engine I point out the outside temperatures because I thought that was the reason for the lack of activation of the start amp stop I have ruled out the possibility that the seat belt is not fastened and the battery is low. it does not activate when I switch off the engine at traffic lights, take the key out of the ignition and start up again. it activates when in gear, it deactivates. it never activates after a start-up without start amp stop. You can immediately feel what the manufacturer says about it: new bearings and seals with low friction and the use of a specific high-efficiency lubricant. I have noticed the more precise road holding and stability, perhaps as they say, because of the engine that has been lowered by millimetres with a lower centre of gravity. if you have to base the whole hybrid on the bsg electric system and this is activated when it wants to, you will always be alone with the thermal engine at start-ups without start amp stop and therefore consumption and the environment goes to hell without changing anything from a practical point of view. I don't think I'll take it to a garage to have it checked as I already know the answers I'll see in the next few months how it behaves in the May update after about km the hybrid system seems to work perfectly it shuts down and restarts regularly so I think the problem was the cold weather consumption is around one litre not bad
Honestly I was very curious about this model of at the same time without too many expectations during the road test I really changed my mind my opinion seems to me that this engine despite being a thousand three cylinders and not a thousand and two four cylinders has a little more cue very quiet even on bumpy city roads yes of course and a car that must like since part of the interior redesign and some expedient regarding the radio with various management functions very practical and functional always the same line as the previous one maybe given the total absence of assistance systems lane control emergency braking and whatnot would have been a good compromise to mount full front LED headlights rather than halogen ones with lens very nice LED rear lights. lane control emergency braking and anything else would have been a good compromise to mount full front LED headlights rather than halogen ones with lens very nice rear LED lights in the end I was convinced to buy the sport version a little more distinct from the others in the end and always a micro hybrid and for its price and very affordable because between state incentives and dealer discounts you bring home an excellent price considering the advantages that you can take advantage of every city related to hybrid cars certainly a car with some compromise to be considered certainly convenient for its purchase price turnkey
The mild hybrid is the most useless thing ever, a real joke, a rape of buyers' wallets. I feel sorry for journalists who are paid to say things they don't mean for the poor wretches, such as those who drive thousands of kilometres a year, drive a lot of motorway and don't have a garage, and therefore no electrics, you idiots, wake up!
Come on, please, enough with this crap! It's a car with years of service behind it, we can retire it and replace it with a new model. It's been offered in all sorts of different versions, a thousand thousand different versions, but it's always the same old crap.
So, guys, we have to spend a lot of money to make electrics, really a lot of money, like we sell all these advanced pandas, an inexpensive battery, a big gas crap on the recycled interior, a higher gear in the gearbox, and that's it, no one will realise that it costs the same as the other one, and it's the same.
As a toyota owner, that hybrid writing is getting on my nerves. Europe, however, makes laws to cheat manufacturers and they take full advantage of it, and rightly so, and with the volt peg perego and the gearbox to the neutral gearbox energy saving style ritmo and regata docunt we have privileges in the face of the poor people who may have just bought a Mr. that diesel euro and os cannot use it.
too butch for my taste, I can't find a better term for those chrome mirrors, the ostentatious white of tacky plastic, etc. in answer to your question. cheers
it seemed that with the catalytic converter we would solve the pollution problem now hybrids we continue to spend more are only palliatives the real solution is to reduce the population","The most important comments on the Fiat hybrid model reflect a strong dissatisfaction among users. The central issue is the unreliable hybrid system, particularly the start-stop feature, which often fails, especially in colder weather, undermining its fuel efficiency and environmental benefits. Users criticize the hybrid technology as superficial, suggesting it is more of a marketing gimmick rather than a functional improvement. They also highlight the car’s lack of modern safety features like lane control and emergency braking. Despite some praise for the car’s design and handling, the overall sentiment remains negative due to high maintenance costs, the perceived outdated nature of the model despite numerous versions, and frustration over regulatory loopholes that favor superficial hybrid solutions. Users also mention that hybrid technology does not address the root cause of pollution and advocate for more significant measures like population control."

Yes people who know about cars are unable to understand that there are other people who go where a normal sedan can't squeeze in, let alone crossovers. This is a small city car for one or two people who look at a car differently and don't need a mix of a taxi and a lorry with perfect engine. But it will park on any spot and squeeze through traffic where other assholes will stand and snort irritably with its powerful and perfect engine. If I were younger, I might even have bought such a car. When I was young, the choice was between red-coloured Zhiguli and blue-coloured Zhiguli.
in the west people use this car for city driving especially italian small streets and endless serpentines easy parking excellent visibility and stylish look you can of course drive a cruiser but most likely you will be considered a lumberjack who came to the city to rent a milkmaid buying a versatile car is a sign of poverty.","The important comments highlight the Fiat 500 as a stylish and practical city car. Users appreciate its compact size, making it ideal for navigating narrow streets, easy parking, and good visibility. The car's appeal includes its charming design and practicality, with features like hill start assist and air circulation settings. However, some criticize the lack of an automatic gearbox and the hybrid system's effectiveness. The car is seen as perfect for city dwellers but less suited for those needing more power or space. The European tour enthusiasts emphasize its reliability even for long trips."
Topic 2,least_important,"It's not a polemic, merely a consideration. I only consider a hybrid car if it is only electric for a few kilometres, otherwise it's just a lot of hooey. I had a panda hybrid with a rental km for ten days in Sardinia, with absurd consumption of medium-litre kilometres, and yet I've been driving the toyota hybrid for six years.
i've been driving a model year without roof antenna la great equipment for al only car i don't regret it for a second and would buy it again i can't confirm the fuel consumption values and range stated in the video but they are much better for me commuting km sum day with city traffic and somewhat speed-limited motorway the boot is tiny, however, and the back seat is bearable for small children at most if you can cope with it you can buy it
as nice as a rear-wheel drive may be i don't think a rear engine makes sense even for electric vehicles if the vehicle is primarily intended to be an everyday vehicle because the engine in the rear simply still takes up an insane amount of space it would be better to put the engine at the front and if you have rear-wheel drive, drive it through to the rear using a cardan shaft, as this costs a little bit of throughput efficiency, but in return you also have a boot that is appropriate for the dimensions
years ago we bought my wife a TK as a typical car whim. very nice car, typical small city car for women. my wife is in love. she doesn't want to think about changing it.
well made video on hybrid the opinions of course diverge even further than the meaningfulness of the application possibilities if i wanted to see a mild hybrid positively it might whet the appetite for bevs and is thus the last milestone of some combustion engine drivers on this path conceptually i can't get anything out of an mhd for my needs, especially with front-wheel drive i'd rather wait for the e and hope very much that it will have a rear engine and rear-wheel drive","The least important comments focus on users' mixed experiences with hybrid and electric cars. Some users find hybrid cars inefficient unless they offer significant electric-only mileage, while others appreciate the Fiat's practicality despite its small boot and back seat. Concerns about the rear engine taking up space and a preference for front engine designs are noted. Additionally, there's a sentiment that mild hybrids may spark interest in fully electric vehicles. Personal anecdotes highlight satisfaction with the car as a small city vehicle, particularly among female drivers."
Topic 2,most_important,"I confirm this I bought it in April, I have the heigougle convertible and I can guarantee it is fun to drive and at the same time very efficient and ready to drive it also has that naughty noise from the exhaust that makes it very sporty I also have a sporty set-up that doesn't hurt buy it blindfolded I got a zero mileage genoa
there's little you can do here: we are dealing with a glamorous product with a premium feel and an eco-friendly look, and what's more, it's fuel-efficient - you don't pay road tax for years, you park in the blue lines and have access to the ztl - what more do you want?
A moment of reflection: it is illegal to have a mobile phone in your hand while driving, while getting lost among the numerous multi-function displays showing futuristic functions while driving reminds me of the speed cameras positioned after a steep downhill slope, which are regularly and artfully hidden, obviously for safety reasons. The only reason to consider it is said in the video that there are no traffic jams, which would lead to terrorism. Am I wrong? I say this because recently many Italian municipalities, their mayors, have gone so far as to block even electric cars, not even mopeds can circulate any more, unless they are electric. I'm not questioning the work of commercial journalists, let's be clear, everyone does what they have to as the end consumer I'd like to hazard a thought, in a loud voice, addressed to the Italian politicians who allow our cities to be plastered with posters that don't talk about cars, but say free to move, even with traffic blocks. I ask this question because it seems to be the practice of some car manufacturers to omit it, not to provide for it at all, let alone recommend it in view of the costs. Perhaps it would be morally correct to inform the unsuspecting buyer beforehand, perhaps by proposing an extension of the warranty as a valid alternative solution.
i find it disgraceful for motor also all the other newspapers to use pieces of fiat promotional videos not made by you and edit them together with your evidence do you think the viewers of youtube videos of all newspapers all the same giuliano i am very surprised at you it is very clear in some points that you do not believe what you are saying this is called advertising only
hybrid cars are a load of rubbish in the end they always have a combustion engine they pollute the same abroad there are hydrogen distributors for this country black gold is more important
kwh which in normal use is difficult to pass because of the speed of recharging we cannot discharge it below ten so we are left with a useful, let's say optimistic wh in short, a notebook battery the electric motor is hp i.e. about kw this will give us an autonomy of about a minute and a half from full energy recovery a minute and a half of help not electric autonomy these are very modest numbers in my opinion to be considered interesting
they criticise fiat for shoddy materials and the same equipment and fittings, the difference between fiat and other brands is a few euros, beautiful lines and high-mileage engines. bravo fiat
since it is not compulsory to type-approve cars with the wltp cycle because consumption with the old cycle is quoted when you actually see them km lt this crazy downhill as the system advises

The car's premium feel, eco-friendly look, and fuel efficiency, which include tax benefits and access to restricted traffic zones, are appreciated. Concerns are raised about the practicality and honesty of promotional videos, as well as the effectiveness of hybrid technology compared to hydrogen options. There are criticisms of Fiat's material quality and equipment but acknowledgment of its high-mileage engines and beautiful design. Additionally, there's frustration over confusing information regarding fuel consumption and electric vehicle policies."

Users mention issues with the hybrid system being seen as a way to meet EU emission regulations, concerns about engine reliability, and inefficiencies at high speeds. Some users appreciate the iconic design of the Fiat Linea and its historical significance. The hybrid system is viewed by some as a smart move for reducing emissions and offering benefits like free parking and no traffic restrictions. Others criticize the car's value and compare it unfavorably to competitors like the Yaris hybrid. There's a desire for simpler, effective fuel-saving systems to be standard in all models, and a recognition of the car's practicality for city driving despite some limitations in space."

Owners express affection for the Fiat Dolcevita, highlighting its style, performance, and exhaust note. Some find it ideal for city driving and as a second family car. Criticisms include a noisy gearbox and quirks with the Celespeed robot. There are also requests for comparative reviews with other cars like the Mini. Overall, the comments provide varied yet superficial insights into the car's features and driving experience."

they produced it hybrid to avoid sanctions with the eu to reduce emissions medium excellent car the is a true fiat linea that stands out among a thousand foreign cars all the same and anonymous it is an Italian icon that will always remain in automotive history
As a mechanic, I can tell you that small-cylinder engines with such a high compression ratio will break down, and this whole thing of attaching a battery and making it a hybrid is just so that it can be type-approved, as others do, trust me, LPG is still the best.
perfect and more than a thousand euros I'll throw a few thousand away and look for a nice old series rear wheel drive and in a few years my car will still be worth a lot of money, whereas these will already be abandoned on scrapyards
it would be nice to make an electric drive with a cm engine acting as a bmw-like range extender generator too bad there is perhaps not enough space to fit it all in
There are those who wonder what's the point of this car. In my opinion, it's the smartest car on the market, with a small electrification it will allow the brand to lower emissions and thus sell the rest of the range, and it will have all the advantages of a hybrid, free blue parking spaces and no traffic restrictions.
they've had vodka soup and crack thousand euros for a car that does km per litre for the same price I'll take a yaris hybrid, which is a beautiful car with a hybrid engine that has been tested for years, does km per litre and is clearly more beautiful and technological fiat just deserves to be closed down and is paying the price for not having renewed itself for years
secondly it costs just a few thousand euros production year in a while you can register it inside the asi registers and make it a vintage car so the price doubles
a good, intelligent system that is not too complicated and which really does reduce fuel consumption, even if only slightly, should be offered as standard on all cars and all versions, and with just a few more per car, the miserly Europe would be screwed - no fines","The most important comments from Topic 3 reveal a mixed reception of hybrid technology in Fiat cars. While some users appreciate the Fiat Linea's iconic design and its ability to lower emissions and reduce fuel consumption, others criticize the hybrid system as a gimmick to meet EU regulations. Concerns include potential engine breakdowns due to high compression ratios and inefficiencies at high speeds. Some prefer LPG over hybrid systems. There's a call for simpler, intelligent fuel-saving systems to be standard across all models. Opinions on the car's market value and long-term worth vary, with some seeing potential in vintage status."

Some users appreciate the brand's unique charm and reliability, citing their personal experiences with various Fiat models. The Firefly engine receives praise for its performance. However, several users criticize the hybrid's fuel consumption and performance, particularly in comparison to the previous Twin Air model. There's frustration over the perceived forced shift away from diesel vehicles. Comments also reflect a general confusion about the technology and innovation in the hybrid models, with some feeling it's lacking.

I'll say this, I used to work on delivery on fiat so the only plus is a beautiful car the rest is complete shit and specifically the engine burns oil so much that the box hums the suspension is so stiff that every pothole as on a stool you pass the place is very little in the corners is terrible car is stupid for ponts.
on the KA the box is manual and it's fun, but yes it's shaky and yes it's not respected on the road I've driven and I know and yes there's an updated KA coming out soon, apparently they've advertised it to take old stock and it might be all-electric but it's not for sure.

Some praise the car for its appearance and driving experience, with mentions of test drives and features like ASR traction control. There are also comparisons to other brands like Mercedes and BMW. A few comments are more critical, highlighting issues like oil consumption, stiff suspension, and limited space. Others are brief and focused on personal preferences or past experiences with Fiat and other cars. Overall, these comments are a mix of superficial observations and personal anecdotes without deep insights into the car's performance or features."

That is, let me understand all this technology to have a car that, if you step on the gas a little, can do kilometres to the litre are they joking? Fiat has discontinued the twin-air engine that had hp and did almost kilometres to the litre.
In practice it's a joke the pump my grandfather used to pull water from the well in his garden was more powerful please hp on a tonne of car powered by an ah battery is like trying to pull a bus with a child's electric car marchionne was right it's just a smoke and mirrors at present the only technology that's green enough is natural gas lpg
I don't understand a city car with a manual gearbox when the continuous stop-and-go certainly benefits the automatic, and then a boost of just one hp from the electric motor makes one think of something improvised in order to fall within the pollution parameters imposed by the European Community. Lastly, a three-cylinder with just one hp is not in line with the competition, which is also designed only for new drivers, all the other performance enthusiasts. In short, a product that is always beautiful and elegant and highly successful, with a motorisation that leaves many perplexed.
clearly fca is marking time compared to other manufacturers in this respect marchionne has not done a great job. surely there must have been a reason for this choice. in any case, the car is a great little car, well made and clearly superior in terms of quality, finish, taste and design compared to its direct competitors.
finally a new car we're at the theatre of the absurd they put a power bank for mobile phones under the seat just to take the hybrid rebates fiat is like the pd, more and more ridiculous no one moves a finger
people only buy these types of cars for economy in maintenance they are mechanically ridiculous and this mild hybrid technology that would be adding a powerbank under the seat is really ridiculous
I don't want to speak ill of the product well it will be the product to do so if everything goes well and is within the declared purchase and consumption costs if problems start as was usual with fiat then it will be the last resort because there are brands that don't create problems at least for the first year plus always warranty to think about

Some users are pleasantly surprised by its style, handling, and driving experience, comparing it favorably to other cars. However, there are significant criticisms regarding the vehicle's performance, particularly its hybrid system, which some describe as underpowered and a gimmick. Concerns are raised about the manual gearbox in city traffic, fuel consumption, and the overall efficacy of the hybrid technology. While the design and quality are praised, many users express doubts about the car's practicality and value, suggesting that Fiat's approach might be more about meeting regulatory requirements than providing real benefits to the driver."

Topic 5,least_important,"good friends i am going to tell you my personal test of this car or charette i rented this car week in sicily and carried out more than km with city and motorway in positive i could note the dimension of the car adapted to the cities not to take itself the head the style even if i do not like it deserves to have a unique style which pleases many people the quality of the interior for this type of car as well as the surprising comfort of seats finally the retractable roof of the c which is a real kif on the other hand less rejoicing here is the weak point an immensely soft engine in rise you will not exceed the on road and on motorways you will have to wait for a descent of the car. motorways you'll have to wait for a descent to go faster a supple chassis and lousy road holding for such a small car but above all what makes it the worst car I've ever driven this continuous deceleration as soon as you let go of the accelerator which in my opinion recharges the false hybridisation system. false hybridization it is impossible to keep a constant speed the car brakes alone it is dangerous and exhausting and good luck for the radar because if you want to stay to you will be either to or to horrible this last point is prohibitive I put because of it what is a pity because without that it is a good small car
I drove the e for a test drive and then transferred approx. km how cool was it because anyone who still has a combustion engine is massively resistant to advice because the car is really fun to drive great I can sit quite well in the front with a good size it is quiet accelerates well and drives like a go-kart despite the small battery the range is sufficient for most applications and quickly refuelled we needed a quick charger from a good minute to a good minute clearly my next own car will be an electrician
nice design and environmentally friendly but the interior does not excite me yet as I am a grande punto owner and the phrase was said times good luck to all
I'd rather buy new than used for a million more
years ago we bought my wife a TK as a typical car whim. very nice car, typical small city car for women. my wife is in love. she doesn't want to think about changing it.","The least important comments in Topic 5 reveal mixed experiences with the car. One user shared a rental experience in Sicily, praising the car's suitability for city driving, unique style, and seat comfort, but criticizing its poor engine performance and dangerous deceleration caused by the hybrid system. Another user enjoyed a test drive of the electric version, appreciating its fun driving experience, quiet operation, and quick charging, leading them to consider purchasing an electric car. Some comments highlighted the car's appealing design and eco-friendliness, although the interior was found lacking by a Grande Punto owner. One user expressed a preference for buying new cars over used ones. Lastly, a user shared their wife's enduring love for her TK, a small city car, and her reluctance to replace it."
Topic 5,most_important,"great beautiful the ancestor is this icon that will forever remain in the history of cars timeless line never gets old blue is breathtaking recognisable among a thousand it has real Italian character unbeatable real cars are made by Italians the others follow
the multi jet consumes less the e turbo fire fly consumes the same old fire consumes slightly more the big difference is in power this mille hibrid is not only difficult but also weak and expensive
they get there after years compared to toyota and among other things they choose the mild hybrid instead of the full hybrid innovation sought by fca
you haven't explained anything about the car and the engine I realised I have to watch the video of the panda if I'm interested in it I don't think it's comparable bah
I have a family petrol car and I'm really curious to try this hybrid engine that the N has always had problems with the control unit, we only realised it when it finally broke last year and with the new control unit the os goes like never before, it was really low on power, according to us we have been driving for years with about 20 hp less, but the os goes really well and considering that it only has kilometres on it I hope it will last for many years to come I'd be interested in buying a lance ypsilon with this engine for my daughter, I hope it comes out in the next year.
ah that seems a bit low also because with kwh capacity the battery is practically v I have an ah v powerbank that practically has kwh of theoretical energy of course if that were really the case this hybrid only has the wording
to travel coasting mode place the gearbox in neutral ahahha a very relaxing drive I would say the hybrid is with automatic transmission a person will never travel in neutral
Unfortunately, the only hybrid that makes sense in terms of real effectiveness is still called a yaris. toyota started out too early and has patented too many solutions to be equalled. the others are doing this nonsense, focusing on full electrics without petrol stations.
they will surely sell many of them in the city until the European level puts a clear rule on how a machine must be structured to be hibryd
Fiat had made an engine that was a bomb, the fire, then they realised that they risked bankrupting their oil company friends and so they invented the twin air, which consumed more fuel os they continue to take the piss out of us with these mild hibrid crap stop it and go back to making electric engines, cars like the fire that did kilometres on a litre of green petrol","The most important comments for Topic 5 highlight a mix of admiration and criticism. Positive feedback includes praise for the car's timeless design, Italian character, and aesthetic appeal. However, many comments express dissatisfaction with the hybrid engine, describing it as weak, expensive, and less effective compared to competitors like Toyota's Yaris. There is criticism of Fiat's choice of mild hybrid over full hybrid, with some suggesting that Fiat's previous engines were more efficient. Concerns about the effectiveness and practicality of the hybrid technology are also prevalent, alongside frustrations with Fiat's approach to innovation and fuel consumption."
