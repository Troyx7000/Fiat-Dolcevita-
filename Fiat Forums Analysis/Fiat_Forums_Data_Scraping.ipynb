I think the easiest thing would be to decode an S3 switch, or the window wiring out of a UK based S4. The prior owner had the switches hooked to an UK S4 car, and prior to sending them to me, he labeled each wire with the color coding of his car. Unfortunately none of the color codes match the US spec car, or anything I've been sent for a UK spec Fiat 500?

      "While driving my Fiat 500 0.9 TwinAir semi-automatic on a busy road, I suddenly received a warning on the dashboard that read \"Check transmission see handbook.\" As a result, I lost engine power and was unable to engage any gear. I ended up having to stop in the middle of the road. Despite trying to turn the car off and on again, the error message continued to display (similar to what happened in this video attached below).\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few more attempts, the car finally started working again, but the experience was quite scary. Has anyone else experienced a similar issue? After doing some research in this forum, it seems that a low level of transmission fluid could be the cause of the problem, but not sure. it was a damp road, I was wondering if could be some electronic issue ? \n",

      "\n",
      "With a starting price of just £7,900 OTR, the new Fiat 500 represents outstanding value for money and positions the car well below its benchmark rivals. At the top end of the range, a highly specified version with a larger engine costs only £10,700 – an OTR price that includes air conditioning and alloy wheels as standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Available with a choice of three frugal, ultra-low emissions, Euro 5-ready engines: 69 bhp 1.2-litre and 100 bhp 1.4-litre petrol, or 75 bhp 1.3-litre MultiJet turbodiesel, the new Fiat 500 can be ordered in three different trim levels – Pop, Sport and Lounge.\n",

      "Sport and Lounge versions start at £9,300, while specifying a larger engine in any trim level adds £1,400. Standard equipment on both Sport and Lounge versions includes the Blue & MeTM hands-free media system, air conditioning and 15” alloy wheels. Sport specification includes a rear roof spoiler, fog lights, sports interior and dark tinted rear windows, while Lounge trim includes a split, folding rear seat and fixed glass roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "The simple pricing structure means that any combination of car is possible – customers simply start with a 1.2 Pop and add £1,400 for a more powerful engine, £1,400 for a higher trim level, or £2,800 for any combination of both. A huge list of style options – created specifically to offer customers wide-ranging opportunities for personalising the interior and exterior of their vehicles – is also available.\n",

      "Despite the appearance of two ‘everyday’ cars in the top five, the index reinforces the trend that high-end and luxury cars are disproportionally targeted by vandals.\n",

      "Robin Reames, Chief Claims Officer at swiftcover.com, offered advice to drivers: “While vandalism is difficult to prevent, there are several measures that motorists can take to protect their cars and make them less likely to be targeted.

      "Richard Ingram, Editor, DrivingElectric, said: “Last year’s DrivingElectric Car of the Year, the Fiat 500 is still the best in its segment. Reinvented for the electric era, this retro take on the evergreen small car is nippy, agile and fun to drive – with a range that will satisfy urban drivers twice over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "New Fiat 500 is the first fully-electric Fiat designed from the ground up. The car provides a raft of best-in-class features such as Level 2 Autonomous Driving technologies, a variety of battery options and a substantial driving range of up to 199 miles (WLTP) – the longest range of any electric city car on the market today. The New 500 is also the only 4-seater convertible in its segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sustainable philosophy of the New 500 is reflected not only in the electric powertrain but also within the interior. The seats are partly made with Seaqual® yarn, the weaving of which produces a material derived from recycled plastic, 10 per cent of which originates from the sea and 90 per cent from land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greg Taylor, Fiat UK Country Manager, said: \"With this award, we continue to mark the arrival of New 500 and celebrate its success within the UK and globally. It marks a pivotal moment in making sustainable, connected, and autonomous mobility accessible to UK motorists.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With a host of features such as an all-new infotainment system, plus a convertible option and Level 2 Autonomous Driving – which are both exclusive to New 500 within its segment – as well as four trim levels, there is a New 500 for everyone.”\n",

I've been seriously contemplating coming back to Fiat as per my other thread, naturally I wanted to come back to the Panda but I'm finding they are insanely priced compared to just a few years ago. Shockingly, even here in NI where we pay a bit more for used cars, I'm seeing a lot of quite new, quite decent spec 500 models. This one in particular has the bigger touch screen, new engine, TFT cluster, glass roof, and nice leather steering wheel etc - and it's only two years old and low miles. When I had one for a week in 2019 (a grey one with the white interior) I actually enjoy driving it, but I did get weird looks.

      "Content: ​\n",
      "\n",
      "New FIAT 500 unveiled with new exterior and interior style\n",
      "Highlights include revised front designed with new headlamps, grills, chrome brightwork and LED daytime running lights\n",
      "Rear enhancements include innovative new ‘empty’ light clusters\n",
      "Interior revisions include new Uconnect™ infotainment systems, enhanced comfort and numerous detail improvements\n",

      "High standard safety specification includes seven airbags and a full suite of active safety systems\n",
      "On Sale in September priced from £10,890\n",
      "\n",
      "In Brief\n",
      "\n",
      "July 4 has always been a red-letter date for the FIAT 500. A symbol of mass motorisation in Italy, of which almost 3.8 million were sold, the original FIAT 500 was introduced on this day in 1957. Exactly fifty years later, on July 4 2007, FIAT chose to celebrate that heritage by introducing the New FIAT 500, a car which embodied the same spirit and personality as the original and which has also enjoyed phenomenal success all over the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eight years on, with over 1.5 million produced, the torch is now being passed to the New FIAT 500 with which FIAT is preparing to take on new market challenges without forgetting its illustrious roots. Centro Stile FIAT has refreshed the exterior and interior, retaining the unmistakable 500 look that has made it such a global success but at the same time making even more attractive and contemporary. It has not grown in size but it has grown in maturity with advanced technologies, improved efficiency and even more customisation ideas. In this way, FIAT has carefully evolved and refined the features which have made it an Italian masterpiece in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Available in two body styles (hatchback and convertible), the New FIAT 500 will be available in three trim levels: Pop, Pop Star and Lounge. All models have LED daytime running lights, seven airbags and a Uconnect infotainment system with six speakers, AUX-IN/USB ports and steering wheel remote controls as standard equipment. The Pop Star version in the UK adds air conditioning, body-colour mirror caps with defrosting function and 15-inch alloy wheels, while the Lounge version adds sophisticated features such as a panoramic glass sunroof, rear parking sensors, a chrome front grille, front fog lights, a leather-trimmed steering wheel and a Uconnect 5” LIVE touchscreen infotainment system with smartphone integration and numerous built-in apps to help users stay safely connected while on the move.\n",
      "\n",
      "The engine line-up of the New FIAT 500 at launch includes a 0.9-litre TwinAir engine (85hp or 105hp) and a 1.2-litre 69hp unit. The two-cylinder engines boast exceptional efficiency – 90g/km for the 85hp engine and 99g/km for the 105hp unit – while a new ‘Eco’ configurations of the 1.2 litre 69hp (available after the launch) will reduce emissions to 99 grams of CO2 per kilometre (UK availability TBC).\n",
      "\n",
      "Bold and seductive, the New FIAT 500 benefits from no fewer than 1,800 innovative detail changes, all designed to enhance the ownership experience and refine its inimitable style. Most noticeable are the new front headlights with LED daytime running lights and the new rear light clusters, not to mention the revised colour palette; the revamped dashboard and the improved materials used throughout. The updates are substantial, with a focus on technological evolution, but loyal to the unmistakable 500 style so as not to upset the successful balance of exclusivity and accessibility it embodies. The FIAT 500 is a global best-seller with a quintessentially Italian heart – elegant and stylish but also affordable and packed with fun – and with its carefully considered enhancements, New FIAT 500 will undoubtedly reassert itself as the benchmark in its segment from every perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "​\n",
      "Lingotto in Turin\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingotto in Turin was chosen for the world première of the New FIAT 500. Opened in 1923, the FIAT factory was famed for unusual production process, which worked its way upwards through the building floors with completed vehicles emerging onto its functional test track on the roof. Designed by architect Le Corbusier, Lingotto became a symbol of burgeoning Italian industrialisation even before it was completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "After being decommissioned, Lingotto was renovated to suit the needs of a changing urban fabric but despite the comprehensive interior refurbishment it maintained its symbolic exterior appearance unaltered. As a result, Lingotto remains an important landmark in Turin thanks to the manner in which it has been evolved and adapted over time while remaining true to its tradition, not unlike the iconic FIAT 500, which is why it was selected as the launch venue for this important vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Detail\n",
      "\n",
      "Italian Style Concentrated\n",
      "\n",
      "An important element of the appeal of the 500 has always been its compact shape. The new car retains its city-friendly dimensions – 357cm long, 163cm wide and 149cm tall with a wheelbase of 230cm – but the design of the front and rear ends has been sensitively refreshed to ensure the identity of the popular and beloved 500 remains. The exterior style of the New FIAT 500 expresses all the distinctive elements which characterised the 1957 original but now reasserts this appeal with more a contemporary look and additional technical content.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most obvious reference to the past can be found at the front: New FIAT 500 retains the “face” of its predecessors with headlights which are still circular in shape but have a more dynamic slant to convey a bolder and more confident gaze. These clusters integrate the dipped-beam headlamps and turn signals and use innovative polyellptical modules for improved night vision and extra safety – its 'eyes' are always on the road! The lower light cluster integrates the main beam headlights and LED daytime running lights, which adopt the circular profile of the lamp to graphically reproduces the zeros of 500 allowing the New FIAT 500 to stand out even when it’s dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bonnet retains its distinctive, traditional clamshell form, another nod to its legendary predecessor, and this is complemented by a harmonious, trapezoidal nose which stands out thanks to more pronounced ribbing and complemented by elegant chrome 'whiskers' on both sides of the FIAT badge. The auxiliary air vent is now fed via a three-dimensional grille (with chrome-effect buttons on the Lounge version) flanked by chrome brightwork to give the New FIAT 500 stronger visual presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rear of New FIAT 500 is transformed by the addition of exclusive new 'empty' light clusters comprised of an innovative ring-shaped structure with body-coloured centres. Thanks to these new clusters, which are unique to the segment, light appears to emanate from the bodywork almost like an illuminated tattoo! The rear fog light and reversing light, are relocated to the edges of the redesigned bumper trim, finished either in black or chrome depending on model. This division is functional and guarantees greater light efficiency. Naturally, New FIAT 500 retains the large chrome grab handle that is deliberately reminiscent of the number-plate light of the original FIAT 500.\n",
      "\n",
      "The profile is still soft and round, with an airy glasshouse, minimal overhangs and a very short bonnet, while its beltline is slightly inclined towards the front to give New FIAT 500 a tough, confidence stance. New alloy wheel designs are also introduced in New FIAT 500, offered in 15- and 16-inch sizes and available in a variety of finishes including an elegant diamond-cut design. The colour palette now totals 13 hues (seven pastel, one solid and five metallic) including two new colours: Glam Coral and Avantgarde Bordeaux. Two striking black-yellow and black-red variants are also available as part of the FIAT 500 'Second Skin' initiative which offers a range of customisation options capable of satisfying every creative taste imaginable. Indeed, it is possible for every 500 driver to tailor their cars with exciting new looks, making walking into a dealership increasingly similar to walking into a high-end Italian fashion house.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two types of second skins, the first features a fashionable, geometric pattern along the belt line only, while the larger skin options cover the pillars and roof – and in some cases the bonnet and tailgate as well. Five patterns are offered: Ethnic (geometric pattern); 'Lord' (classic tartan); 'Comics' (pop decoration) in combination with the new two-colour body paintwork; 'Navy' (nautical patterns) and 'Camouflage' (fashionably military). Like a tailor-made garment, everyone can express their own personality with the distinctive 'Second Skin' collection of the New FIAT 500.\n",
      "\n",
      "​\n",
      "Elegance and Innovation Inside\n",
      "\n",
      "The interiors are extensively revised, most noticeably in terms of dashboard design: it now integrates the advanced Uconnect infotainment (touchscreen on the Lounge version) across the range. The unit is not only easier to read and more intuitive to use, it also improves connectivity and functionality. The dashboard dome and air vents are also redesigned to accommodate the new unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new steering wheel features new remote control buttons which are easier to operate and, thanks to their chrome-plated edging and high-quality materials, more pleasant to touch and to behold. The circular instrument cluster, with analogue dials for speed and engine revs and digital secondary gauges, is retained for Pop and Pop Star models, while the innovative seven-inch TFT display, developed in collaboration with Magneti Marelli - the international leader in the design and manufacture of high-tech automotive systems and components – is optional on the Lounge version.\n",
      "\n",
      "The driver can monitor data from the speedometer, odometer and trip computer simultaneously at a glance, while the central section of the display – sporting an image of the car – can be configured to show distance travelled, fuel consumption, range, trip time etc. Warning messages and the Gear Shift Indicator, which advises when to shift gear to maximise fuel-efficiency, are also displayed in this cluster in a highly visible manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The TFT display is also integrated with the Uconnect™ Radio LIVE and Uconnect™ Radio Nav LIVE so that the media player, telephone and navigation messages also appear on the screen and the LCD screen also reconfigures itself when the Sport button is activated on 0.9 TwinAir Turbo 105hp engine versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The front seats adopt a more ergonomic shape and the interior upholstery is available in nine colour combinations with contrasting “crescent” upper portions and head restraints in black or ivory eco-leather. Black, bordeaux or tobacco Frau leather upholstery is also available (depending on model), with embroidered 500 logos on the crescent and contrasting bolster accents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further enhancements include a new lidded glove box on the passenger's side and a revised centre console with new cup holders and a relocated 12V power socket. New electric window switches, which adopt a push-down-pull-up operation, complete the visible interior revisions, while additional soundproofing panels in the wheelhouse and firewall making the passenger compartment even more comfortable and refined.\n",
      "\n",
      "​\n",
      "Always connected with Uconnect™\n",
      "\n",
      "In place of the audio system of the previous 500, the new Uconnect™ system now takes pride of place in middle of the dashboard of the New FIAT 500. On the entry-level version, the system includes; FM/AM radio; remote controls on the steering wheel; AUX-IN and USB ports and six speakers as standard. Lounge models are equipped with the Uconnect™ 5” Radio LIVE system which is a touchscreen unit complete with Bluetooth hands-free calling, voice recognition and an SMS reader for reading text messages received on compatible telephones using 'text to speech' technology. The driver can connect multimedia devices via USB or using the 3.5mm auxiliary jack or stream music via Bluetooth using a compatible smartphone. DAB digital radio is also available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uconnect™ LIVE services also debut on the New FIAT 500 (UK availability TBC). The Uconnect™ LIVE app can be downloaded from Apple Store or Google Play Store and as soon as the smartphone is connected to the New FIAT 500 Lounge, many applications can be viewed and controlled via the touchscreen of the Uconnect™ system. The apps have been designed and adapted for use while driving to keep users concentrated on the road ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uconnect™ LIVE allows direct access via the touchscreen to TuneIn Internet radio, with over 100,000 stations worldwide; Deezer Internet music, with over 35 million tracks for ’Deezer Premium‘ users; Reuters, to keep up-to-date on the most recent world news, and Facebook and Twitter, for staying in touch with friends. Uconnect™ LIVE can also be used to access ecorive, the award-winning driving style app which assists drivers to improve fuel consumption by up to 16 percent and contributes to reducing CO2 emissions by providing driving tips in real time. Uconnect™ LIVE even connects directly to my:Car with real time warnings, service deadline memos and an interactive owner handbook to manage car maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time on the FIAT 500, an integrated Uconnect™ 5” Radio Nav LIVE with voice-activated TomTom satellite navigation is available as an option. The TomTom IQ Routes® function calculates the fastest route based on real-time average speeds and for maximum safety and ease-of-use the system includes an advanced lane indicator, to ensure you’re in the correct lane at complex and unfamiliar junctions or intersections, as well as turn-by-turn instructions which are safely displayed on the instrument panel. The TomTom Live service taps into the world's biggest source of traffic information with over 100 million of monitored kilometres of traffic data collected every day. The navigation system updates every two minutes allowing the Uconnect™ system suggest faster routes and provide more accurate estimated arrival times. In addition to real time information on traffic conditions, users can also benefit from the information on the location of fixed and mobile safety cameras and weather forecasts. Finally, with TomTom Search & Go users can run searches by category or type, like petrol stations or supermarkets, and be directed there.\n",
      "\n",
      "​\n",
      "Environmentally friendly engines\n",
      "\n",
      "The New FIAT 500 is powered by a range of environment-friendly, Euro 6-compliant engines combined with five- and six-speed manual gearboxes or a Dualogic robotised transmission depending on the model. The engines line-up available at launch include the 1.2 litre 69hp, the TwinAir 85hp and the TwinAir 105hp.\n",
      "\n",
      "The TwinAir 0.9 85hp has an official fuel consumption figure of 74.3MPG or 3.8 litres/100 km on the combined cycle with CO2 emissions of 90g/km, remarkable figures which not only have positive environmental implications but which also ease the burden on the owner's pocket too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The New FIAT 500 range will be expanded after the launch with the 1.2-litre 69hp engine in 'Eco' configuration and the 1.3-litre 16v Multijet II 95hp turbo diesel unit. Please note, the UK availability of both engines is to be confirmed. The 1.2 ‘Eco’ will be equipped with a smart alternator, a specific aerodynamic pack and new 14- or 15-inch tyres with low rolling resistance and high resistance to wear resulting in a reduction in CO2 emissions from 110 to just 99g/km. The New FIAT 500 is the only car in its segment, alongside the FIAT Panda, to offer a small diesel engine ideally suited for those with long commutes into congested cities: The 1.3-litre 16v Multijet II 95hp will emits only 89 grams of CO2 per kilometre and comply with Euro 6 standards when it goes on sale later in the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Safety and comfort at the top of its segment\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineered to comply with the toughest standards, the FIAT 500 is one of the safest cars in its segment. The popular 1.2 69hp version is now equipped with larger brake discs for even more effective and powerful braking, and seven airbags (front, window and side airbags, plus a driver’s knee airbag) remain standard across the range as before. Active safety systems include ABS with electronic brake distribution (EBD), advanced electronic stability control (ESC), anti-slip regulation (ASR), Hill Holder and hydraulic brake assistance (HBA) to help with emergency stops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Range: A NEW FIAT 500 for all tastes and requirements\n",
      "\n",
      "The New FIAT 500 will be available with three trim levels – Pop, Pop Star and Lounge – and in hatchback and convertible versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Standard equipment across the range includes seven airbags, Uconnect™ Radio with six speakers, AUX-IN and USB ports and steering wheel remote controls as well as LED daytime running lights. The Pop Star version adds air conditioning, body-coloured mirror caps with defrosting function, 15-inch alloy wheels and a 50/50 split folding rear seat with rear headrests while the Lounge model adds luxury equipment including a panoramic glass sunroof, rear parking sensors, a leather-trimmed steering wheel, front fog lights, chrome front grille and the touchscreen Uconnect™ infotainment system.\n",
      "\n",
      "A full range of Mopar accessories is also available from launch, including vintage-style wheel trims; a range of alloy wheels with different designs, colours and finishes; mirror caps either in chrome-effect or painted in a variety of colours; distinctive side badges; chrome roof mouldings; a rear spoiler and a range of decals for sides and the roof. A tailgate rack is also available with two systems for transporting winter sports equipment, like skis and snowboards.\n",
      "\n",
      "New customisation kits with original roof wraps and mirror caps will also be available. Five colours are available: microcarbon black, matt silver, matt titanium, military green and jeans. The microcarbon black and military green variants also extend to the dashboard to pick up the special exterior inside the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new FIAT 500 will go on sale in the UK in early September with prices starting at just £10,890 OTR. More details will be made available closer to the vehicle’s launch.\n",

      "\n",
      "I just bought my partner her first car a 2013 Fiat 500 ta. She really wanted a beetle but after test driving and researching the models available in my budget I ruled them out. I broke the news softly and suggested the Fiat 500 and after a few days she came around. I did a bit of research and test drove a Fiat 500 1.2 but the 69hp didn't really take my fancy, everything else was great so I made the choice to go for the twinair. There were none available in Ireland in her desired colour Volare blue so we found one that ticked the boxes in the UK. I drove her 900 miles back from Newcastle to Cork and it was an absolute pleasure. Since then she has driven the car twice and fallen in love with it and even given her a name lol. The car isn't perfect and I would be lying if I said it was but then again it's not a new car. It has the odd mark on it here and there and the most obvious thing is the hub caps are pop not colour therapy. But the car is exactly what we wanted colour and option wise. I'm looking forward to getting to know all of you and thanks in advance.\n",

I did a parasitic drain test and found a 0.4mAh current draw with everything off, doors closed, nothing plugged into the ciggy socket but I didn't know if that was normal or not, so a visit to an auto-electrician was on my to-do list. I never got there. The battery finally gave it up and I couldn't revive it with my home charger. I took the battery back to the shop I bought it from and they put it on their workshop charger and revived it. \n",
      "At that point I decided this was it - last resort before going to an auto-electrician. I stripped out the back of the car and disconnected the wiring loom from the B&M module. A few days later, I went away on holiday. The car sat for 6 days unused and I've jumped in today and started it. It fired up instantly. The drain problem would have absolutely killed the battery after 6 days on the driveway so I'm calling it fixed, and most definitely linked to a dead B&M module.\n",
      "I still haven't found an explanation why a dead module drains the battery so my purely speculative reasoning is that the B&M module has it's own independent power feed but is powered on and off by the head unit. When it lost connectivity with the head unit, it remained powered on constantly. Hence, battery drain.\n",

This then directs you to 'Mopar Connect, I registered the car at 'My Fiat' and it is there but won't show in 'Mopar Connect' and it won't let you add the vehicle. I contacted Fiat UK but as it wasn't a new car they said go to my local dealer, I contacted my local dealer and they want to book the car in and charge me £99 before they will look at it! I am pretty sure that there is no problem with the car so I dug further. Someone suggested updating the firmware which sounds like a good call, however, when I go to the area to get the update at driveuconnect.com/support/software-update it asks for VIN number and when I enter it nothing happens, I've checked the VIN and used it to register the car at 'My Fiat' and it is good. Been around in circles for days with no luck, really frustrated. Any ideas on how to connect and use the Uconnect services?

But from what can easily be obtained I did a quick calculation and find that for about £6000 you could have enough to build about 75% of the shell.

It only sells with 60 day warranty and on our test drive I noticed an error code pop up on the dash but as I was in passenger seat, I couldn't see it fully before it flashed off. What would she be getting herself into with this engine (my 2014 is 1.2 engine) and should she consider getting something else since there is a warning code on this particular car? Thanks for help...

Having offered up the hub cap to the wheel I can see that there is about a 5mm gap between the hub cap and the wheel at the centre hole, but not enough of a gap to weld a nut to the outside of the wheel. I wandering of it is possible or necessary to cut a hexagonal hole in the centre of the wheel and weld a nut part way into the wheel.\n",

      "Content: Hello all, I purchased a 1971 Fiat 500L on the opposite side of the country (United States) and I'm trying to figure out the best way to get it home. I had an east coast road trip planned (where the car is located) prior to buying it so I'm trying to figure out what my best course of action is. I can ship or trailer the car back with me, or for what I believe will be a significant cost savings, and way more fun, I could attempt to drive it back home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Per google maps my route, avoiding highways, will be around 4,354 miles and a extremely optimistic 84 hours (I'm expecting well over 100hrs of drive time). If I decide to drive I plan on carrying some spare parts with me I've read through a few other posts and seen that ignition condensers and the flexible joint drives are good things to carry. I'll probably also do an oil change as well as fresh spark plugs and wires upon picking up the car. Are there any other parts that would be smart to carry in the car? Additionally, will it hurt these cars to sit flat out for extended periods of time, or should I try to keep the car around 50mph? I get the impression that the throttle in these cars is on the floor majority of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the route, I will not be heading directly home, I am going to start near Philadelphia, drive down to Washington DC, spend some time in Shenandoah national park before heading down to southern Florida, then returning to Utah from there. I'm a little concerned about driving over the mountains but I expect that it's possible but will be very slow. This trip will take roughly 3 weeks, and I will be stopping at various family members houses along the way so I will have space to repair the car as required so long as parts are available.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little back story on me personally. I frequently drive very long distances to climb mountains / or visit national parks so I'm no stranger to driving long distances, I typically average around 50,000 miles a year with only 10,000 of that being normal commuting miles. I also last year drove a 1960 Mini from Miami to Kansas City (around 2,200 miles total, unfortunately from there the car had to be trailered home due to a failed Spicer Joint that I was not able to find / replace quick enough to get home in time) in the middle of summer, so I'm no stranger to the suffering that driving an old car like this can bring, though I had a great time, the Mini made around 3x the power as this little fiat will so it also made things a little easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this is the part where I ask, is this a terrible plan? Should I be smart and trailer it / ship it from the onset? What's the smallest size trailer we can comfortably get one of these cars on? Is this the greatest idea you've ever heard and it sounds like the most fun you could have in a 500?\n",

I didn't like the grey (too boring), the black looked manly, so ended up with red on red. I also chose the cloth over leather because I find cloth more comfortable and mainly cos it was cheaper.

We were fed on really good pastas though and got a good look around all the first models. Seeing the live party in London being broadcast at all the dealership too all helped give a sense of occasion to it. We also learnt that the build quality was good and safety features were impressive.\n",

We’ve put things off like holidays and moving house, so she can save the rest needed to buy her “realistic, red Italian supercar beginning with F”. The time is nearly here as my 22year old run-around won’t last much longer.

My silver dream machine was a lovely start to my driving lessons, but I swear it’s invisible on wet, grey days! I didn’t know the pearl/shimmer red had been out for a year until I saw a Ragamuffin Red on the dealership forecourt last summer! I immediately knew it wasn’t Pasadoble. By then I’d missed out on the Scrappage Scheme though, VAT went up, and now a summer price increase again, so I’ve been saving to add the difference onto my original £10K.\n",
      "Pasadoble is a nice, true red, but it’s a flat one-dimensional red in comparison to Ragamuffin. \n",
      "R-Red looks very similar if you see it on its own but if you put them side by side (I’ve seen this) the difference is so obvious – especially when the sun hits. R-Red shimmers slightly and seems to be a shade more towards an orange-red then, until it darkens over again as the clouds pass. It’s an optional extra, but I say worth it for the little surprise you get in the sun every so often. Also, Fiat dealership says the metallic paint is generally stronger, extra layers needed to achieve the finish, generally do make metallic paint the tougher choice, thus it should be more resilient to chipping. \n",

      "After a friends partially tuned car suffered a breakdown and had to be recovered the breakdown man blamed it on the carb so I got to hear about it pdq as I sold the carb to the guy. I expressed surprise as I said it was by far and away the best condition Panda 30 carb I had ever had my hands on, straight off a low mileage car complete with manifold and head. As Bugsymike says it is often hard to tease out the story of what happened but between two accounts I pieced it together. Car would tick over but was very reluctant to Rev and as the throttle was applied the engine would misfire with associated pops and bangs. \n",
      "this sounded a familiar story to me but I did some internet research anyway focusing on condenser failures. They can just pack up or often deteriorate over time as the internals break down. One guy had written an extensive thesis on condensers including a forensic analysis of failed ones which he opened up to identify what went wrong. A number of points arose :\n",
      "1) If you have an old condenser that is working leave it alone.\n",
      "2) Many replacement condensers are now poor design and manufacture so more prone to failure.\n",
      "3) Seek out old or original stock where possible with one guy from the US recommending getting used ones from car breakers.\n",
      "4) The racing spec ones were recommended for reliability but also old Lucas condensers got a high rating.\n",
      "Still waiting to hear about the broken down car but fingers crossed that a decent condenser saves the day.\n",
      "Apart from Fiats I have been caught out by condensers on an old Renault 14, back of nowhere in France luckily I had the old one in the boot, also on a Saab when a new one was knackered from the start.\n",

On inspectin the tyre wall had exploded on what looks like a seam. i know they prob dont have a seam but right where the is a raised ring around the tyre wall is where it blew. when it has blasted it ripped through towards the alloy wheel and has blasted a small chunk out of the alloy wheel and it black around the chip off the blow. The car is only 5 weeks old, done 1300 miles and despite anyone saying i prob damaged the tyre wall, i have never banged the wheels or tyres, nor kerbed it or anything, i really feel this is a flawed tyre. I am awaiting a call back from fiat uk, but really feel i shoudnt foot the bill for a tyre and alloy repair, and i am somewhat concerned if it is a flaw, the others could be from the same batch of production. i as lucky because i was doing 70 mph ten mins before, the 500 could have been worth 500 scrap. anyone any thoughts before fiat get back to me. cheers\n",

I could go and try the one I'm thinking of buying but I am not very good at those kind of situations and wanted to get more of an idea before I did.

I changed the battery, blew out fuel lines, cleaned the fuel filter, replaced spark plugs. It is cranking but not starting. Last drive she started stuttering and needed a lot of gas to stay alive, then shut off and did not fire up again. That engine is so tiny, I keep wondering what else can be wrong with it.

I did change the third brake light and reverse light bulbs but they still didn't work. Finally, I took the car to Fiat, paid the $150 diagnostic fee & a day later they told me that my CTM (Convergence Telematics Module) needs replacement since that's what controls all of those things that failed.

      "Having followed the development of the Abarth 500 right from the spy shots on the Nurburgring to the first sight of it at Goodwood Festival of Speed I was eager to actually drive one; I got that opportunity last weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "The launch was a rather low key affair compared to the spectacle that was the Fiat 500 UK launch at the London Eye, being spread across the exclusive Abarth dealerships. The cars had actually been on site for several weeks before and this news quickly spread among the Italian Car scene. It was cool to see launch stocks all in their white transit wraps with “Do not open” stickers. So having already sat in the car a few weeks before launch I booked a test drive for the launch day and arrived an hour early – I was so looking forward to it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Test car was a 135 bhp example in Grey with optional 17\" alloys, leather trim and decal pack. The powerhouse is the 1.4 16v turbo 'T-jet' engine already proven in the Grande Punto in 120bhp form and in the latest Bravo at 150bhp. In the 500 Abarth in standard tune it makes 135, which is enough to power the car to 62mph in 7.9 seconds. Cars fitted with the optional SS (Super Sport or Esseesse, for those channelling the Italian vibe) pack benefit from a remapped 160bhp engine, along with suspension and brake upgrades; and shave half a second off the 0-62 sprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great looking, the Abarth styling enhances the 500. A larger tailgate spoiler and aggressively restyled bumpers with a rear diffuser mark this baby out as something special. Grey does grow on you... Interior upgrades over Fiat models are good. Great steering wheel! The overall effect is in your face but not too much so that you would be afraid to leave it parked in town. I would say a massive list of extras are not required, other than 17\" wheels at £175.\n",
      "\n",
      "So – the test drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "First impressions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Like a 500 Sport but 'tuned' is a good description, significantly quicker. Chassis feels good, rides high but little pitching and rolling. Raw sounding and more road noise than the Fiat 500 due to the 17\" wheels/tyres.\n",
      "\n",
      "Went for a drive around the back roads, there was still a bit of slush and ice around so had to be careful. Sport mode engaged, TTC left on boost builds quickly and progressively. (Sport mode increases throttle response, and torque; TTC is a form of eDiff or electronic limited slip differential which helps reduce understeer and improve traction out of corners). 5 speed gearbox feels precise and strong and has a much better turning circle that the 6 speed 500 Sport. This is a properly quick and sorted car!\n",
      "\n",
      "Made our way out to the M4 route which I am used to – the chassis really makes you feel confident in applying the power early in the sweeping corner. This car is planted and secure at low and high speeds. Fully opening the taps on the motorway, speed builds easily, even in 5th the boost pushes you back into the seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "All too soon it was time to return to the dealership. What a brilliant car - I wouldn’t change a thing. Not sure it needs the esseesse kit, it is valid in 'base spec'. I understand why the Abarth engineers decided to de-tune the T-jet 150 engine for the masses. It's plenty of power to complement the handling and adds up to a very attractive package.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being a long-time fan of small, sorted FIATs, the new Abarth ticks every box on my wishlist, but I'm also a bit of a hooligan at heart - the new Abarth 500 is SO me! I can't wait to get my hands on one.\n",

      "\n",
      "I found the Panda easy to service with good access, and didn't even need to jack the car up. Only the plugs are a bit fiddly, tucked away deep down at the back of the engine. Taking the throttle body off for cleaning improved access. Oh, and FIAT's coolant hose clips are just mean.

      "Then I started finding all sorts of help on this forum! I had the dreaded power steering failure once, when manoeuvring out of a car park, and found the answer to my problems on here.

      "I thought the off-white would go well with my shade of blue and would give a subtle 'classic Panda' inspired style. Mine even has a tape deck! How's that for retro credentials? Once I'd done it, though, I couldn't help thinking about a junior rally car look. I'm not into modifying my cars, but I'm not against a bit of subtle personalisation and wanted to make sure my Panda wouldn't be mistaken for granny's shopping trolley. I also really wanted a rear spoiler. The 100HP looks so much better for it. Whilst I like the design of the basic Panda inside and out, the rear styling just seems a little abrupt to me, like it got embarrassed and left the room mid-sentence. So I ordered one direct from Team HEKO. Arrived quickly, easy to fix, I'm very happy with it.\n",

      "Whilst treating the rear axle, I noticed the outer skin of the exhaust back box had rusted away, so wire-brushed and painted it black, and thought it looked a bit odd so added a chrome tail pipe tip. I never thought would ever do such a thing, but so many cars have them now that I don't think it looks so daft as I would have thought 10 years or so ago. Finally, I couldn't resist the urge to try the junior rally look with some decals. This is my first Italian car, and I've long wanted an excuse for a Magneti Marelli sticker! I wonder if their ignition will be more reliable than the Lucas & SEV Marchal I grew up with?\n",

After this, removing the boot handle and cleaning the switch has improved it massively, and now the boot lid opens almost every time!\n",

      "We've used our Panda to go camping by removing the rear seats completely, folding the front seats flat and plonking an air-mattress on top. It was, er, cosy! I did sound the horn with my foot in the middle of night once or twice. But it was comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only other conversion for camping was adding interior lights to the rear, which I did by connecting a dual USB socket to the boot light wires. Of course this only gets power when the boot is open, and even then switches off after a few minutes, so it's not much use for devices, but it does give options for USB lights to be connected to illuminate the boot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming up to my first year of ownership, there are so many things I like about the car, and only a couple of things I don't: the rear axle seems like it could have been better designed (and built), and the incessantly self-cancelling indicators are daft (and unnecessarily tricky for learner drivers). Minor gripes for such a cheap car to buy and run, though. I find the follow-me-home lights useful, and I like the way the lights turns themselves off when you kill the ignition (instead of staying on and draining the battery or, even worse, beeping at me).\n",

      "Fiat have clearly been a nightmare to deal with for years or the dealers, and now they are dead in the water, no proper Fiat products to come, and the fact that soon they will have no identity save a badge. Customers have always been enthusiasts or left field, and backed by those needing a cheap car, who have been delighted with the product once bitten and often become loyal. The Fiat twin cam developed its own cult too. They had a reasonable market position but failed to back it or develop anything to encourage follow on for a maturing owner, In future if you want a Peugeot you will probaly just buy one. Not a renadged Fiat. Now there is really nothing left for that market, and at a time when their products could still gain a strong following, had they majored on small petrol and value, they have thrown whatever was left down the toilet. Their electric products are above their pay grade. I feel that selling my newer Fiat now would be sensible, because if spares get hard to find the value will plummet. I wouldnt consider Fiat if buting new, and I dislike Peiigeot as they cheated my dad out of a lot of money in the 90's and I had CItroens until they nearly bankrupted me. Both his Peugeots were mechanical disaters and cost us both huge amounts of money. They dont know how to make a supportive seat either. No way ever again, genuinely I would revert to a bicycle first. Fiat UK seem to have been run by some really stupid and lazy people as far as I can see, hence its no suprise to see them help kill the brand. Im sure many people think there is no point in buying a new ICE car no anyway. Future very uncertain and values worrying for the fear of tax strangulation ahead and the frankly propsterous current price hikes. New sales must be collapsing and the whole market will collapse if nothing is done to help it. In the current economic circumstances people will short change their cars on servicing which will add to the dealers angst. Many people, me included , think servicing an electric car will be a con and will not service the electric cars properly, and I think thee thinngs will be money pits as a result (second hnd) with braking systems being a n=big point of failure and therfore cost. Dont mention down the line battery issues. The electric secondhand market scares me. I dont want to get imvolved in something I cant undertsand - because its entirely new. The future of transport looks gloomy if you cant afford to join the leasing club a very old classic may be the way to go if they are not banned entirely..\n",

The car was brought over from Italy many years ago. It has the round instrument cluster -- like the earlier cars. I am told that the VIN 110 F 5112103 is a 1973.

Unfortunately, I did not have the flywheel surfaced (just cleaned it up with Scotchbrite). It seemed to have a little corrosion. I cleaned all contact areas of plate and flywheel with acetone before assembling. I do see an oil leak that I think is from the crank seal, but also probably the trans input shaft seal as well (90 wt. oil). The clutch plates do not appear to be wet, but I sprayed them a lot with cleaner to make sure. But the chatter is still there. If I have to replace the crank seal, can it be done with the crankshaft in place? Just remove and reinstall the bearing assembly using a new seal? Are new flywheels available? Need advice / help on what to do next. Thanks for any and all helpful input.\n",

This one in particular has the bigger touch screen, new engine, TFT cluster, glass roof, and nice leather steering wheel etc - and it's only two years old and low miles.

      "How much power can a tiny hot hatch take? The Ford Focus RS has proved that 300bhp is manageable - just - in the world of full-size hatchery, but what about the Abarth 500?\n",
      "Fiat's in-house tuning brand will cook you up a 158bhp ‘Esseesse' 500 if you ask them really nicely, but German tunemeister Karl Schnoor - who, contrary to popular believe, does not have the schnow-how - has decided this is not enough.\n",
      "Taking the Esseesse 500 and fitting its 1.4-litre four-pot with a fat new turbocharger, tweaking the ECU and bolting on a big exhaust, Schnoor has bumped the little Abarth's output up to a meaty 197bhp. That's a lot of power in a very small car.\n",
      "Schnoor will also treat your 500 to smart set of 17-inch wheels and a new coilover suspension kit which drops the ride height by a few millimetres. The cost of all this extra fastness? Around £4,500 on top of the donor car.\n",
      "We don't know what Schnoor calls its mad little creation. May we suggest the Esseesseesseesse?\n",

      "Title: Punto 2012+ FIAT Punto 2012 International Debut\n",
      "Content: The New Punto Model Year 2012 is making its debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show. It will go on sale at the beginning of next year across Europe. The model confirms the aspects that destined the previous editions for success in all the European markets and intensifies the distinguished personality with an important aesthetic change, together with the new exterior colours and the seat upholsteries, not to mention significant technological progress with the introduction of the 85 HP 0.9 TwinAir turbo and the evolution of the 85 HP 1.3 Multijet.\n",
      "\n",
      "In detail, on the outside the Punto 2012 model presents a new front distinguished by a bumper entirely painted in the same shade as the body, with the direction indicators positioned alongside the air intake in a single perimeter that surrounds them. On the rear section a shape in relief describes a zone that divides the area dedicated to the number plate from that in which the auxiliary functions of the lights are positioned. Inside, brand-new fabrics upholstering the seats and original inserts of the dashboard that emphasize its stylistic elegance are distinguishable. The new style innovations of the Punto 2012 are completed with a new design of the 15\" alloy rims and new three metallic bodywork colours: Turquoise, Ruby Red and Graphite Grey. In addition, as for the 500 model, the TwinAir name on the Fiat Punto 2012 will indicate not only the revolutionary two-cylinder engine, but also a new trim level with a unique and recognisable look.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, with this new 2012 edition Fiat Punto reaffirms the values that have always distinguished the model: the dynamism and elegance of its lines, a perfect synthesis of Italian style and the technological innovation that since its launch has been a winning feature of the car. The model counts among its records that of being the first car of its class equipped with an advanced infotainment system (Blue&Me) or useful instruments for the customer so he can analyse his driving style in real time (ecorive info) and receive tips on how he can reduce environmental impact and optimising fuel consumption. The Fiat Punto also continues to be a constant point of reference when it comes to engine innovation. They are increasingly livelier and thrifty both with diesel (MultiJet) and petrol (MultiAir) supply, combining innovation with eco-friendliness every single time. Evidence of this lies in the methane or LPG engine, in addition to extending the Stop&Start with Gear Shift Indicator technology to all the Euro 5 engines. This system automatically cuts out the engine and prompts the best gear in order to reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 15% for an urban route. This long tradition of records today is reinforced with the Punto MY 2012 following introduction of new two engineering gems to the range: the 85 HP TwinAir turbo and the evolution of the 85 HP 1.3 MultiJet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "85 HP 0.9 TwinAir turbo\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "​\n",
      "The unprecedented TwinAir, which has won numerous awards in the industry - including \"International Engine of the year 2011\", \"Best New Engine 2011\" and \"Best Green Engine 2011\" - has now been placed on the Segment B top-of-the-range model of Fiat Group Automobiles.\n",
      "The TwinAir project combines all the most modern technology designed by Fiat Powertrain (MulitAir) with the \"downsizing\" concept and is manifest in a small, low-weight engine that ensures excellent performance with low fuel consumption. The special engine tuning and its combination with a 6-speed gearbox confers to the car a perfect balance between eco-friendliness (98 g/km CO2) and driving pleasure (85 HP at 5500 rpm of power and 145 Nm at 2000 rpm of torque). The ECO button is also available. With a specific engine control calibration, it reduces fuel consumption to guarantee truly eco-friendly driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Punto Twin Air customer therefore can choose between two driving modes: \"normal\", with full engine performance to enhance driving liveliness and vivacity, and \"eco\" for driving more attentive to economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "85 HP MultiJet\n",
      "\n",
      "​\n",
      "The 85 HP 1.3 16V Multijet (with a torque of 200 Nm at 1500 rpm) - already today on the cutting-edge thanks to the IRS (Injection rate shaping) technology of the MultiJet II and to the special eco turbo-matching of the turbocharger assembly - takes a further step forward with the introduction of two new technologies (Intelligent Alternator and Intelligent Flow) that let it reach the level of 90 g/km of CO2 emissions. The first technology optimizes the recharging battery strategy during the \"engine cut-off\" phases, while the second is obtained through an oil pump with variable displacement and optimisation of the cooling circuit. These technologies, together with the use of low-viscosity gearbox oil, make the Punto one of the diesel cars in its segment boasting the best CO2 emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2012 range\n",
      "\n",
      "The Punto 2012 is also revamped in its range structure, made clearer and slimmer, optimally epitomizing the editions currently on the market - the Grande Punto and Punto Evo - with the goal of giving the Punto model only one identity with a single styling and enhancing the winning combination of \"style and technology\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In detail, the range comprises 3 trim levels (Pop, Easy and Lounge) available on the different engines, plus a dedicated trim level combined with the TwinAir engine, each featuring a different offer of contents with the goal of satisfying different needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "​\n",
      "The Pop trim level represents the entry level, offered as an accessible, essential, simple and functional version. The second trim level (Easy) is the \"feature model\" of the range thanks to its wealth of equipment, and it offers an outstanding price to accessories ratio. Available in 3 different combinations of interior fabrics (red, blue and grey), this version is the expression of a colourful, youthful, casual, modern, contemporary and technological soul. The top-end is on the other hand represented by the Lounge trim level, which offers both rich and high-tech equipment to provide both ultimate comfort and a strong personality combining elegance and sportiness in an expert aesthetic union.\n",
      "\n",
      "​\n",
      "Finally, the TwinAir trim level was created to enhance the introduction of the 2-cylinder engine by reflecting its lively and agile soul, as the bright and vivid launch shade of Verde Lime combined with the glossy black roof demonstrates. Added to this exclusive body shade are other distinctive styling features such as the burnished alloy rims with dedicated design and diamond treatment, glossy black pillars and mirrors and burnished headlights. The version is also immediately recognisable thanks to the TwinAir logo on the rear tailgate.\n",
      "\n",
      "​\n",
      "Internally, the car is personalised with new interiors featuring grey and black \"Sportex\" fabric and a grey embroidered TwinAir logo on the front headrests. Another TwinAir logo is placed on the dashboard near the climate control system.\n",

So because Cinquecento means 500, I would like to propose for the Summer, that we can get 500 (or more) Cinquecentos to meet up in one place in the Summer. I think its a brilliant idea and maybe we can tie it in with a track day or something. I know its a big project and I'm not even sure that Fiat Forum have 500 Cinquecento owners, but if some people would like to help out, word could get around.\n",

      "The more I think about it the more I worry about the very small dealer network. Servicing is going to be a real issue - simply getting the car to the dealer is one problem and, if the general Fiat network is anything to go by, the quality of the service once you get there is another. At least with my Fiat I have been able to find a good local dealer but sadly unless they get awarded one of the few Abarth Service Centres they will not be able to deal with the 500A. \n",
      "\n",
      "I take issue with Fiat/Abarth and their dealers saying \"But it's not a Fiat, it's an Abarth.\" What a load of old tosh - it's like VW saying a Golf Gti isn't a VW it is a Gti. At the end of the day the Abarth is a mildly sporty Fiat when all's said and done. It isn't an Alpina BMW or a RUF Porsche or anything remotely like it.\n",

The passenger side dash is not made of the same durable plastic material that its other sister Fiat 500s are made out of. It is a soft, cushiony type of plastic that over time builds up a residue or film on the surface. I have tried everything that I can think of to clean it. The cleaners or leather protectants either do nothing or clean it some - and leave scratch marks where the cloth or rag was used.  This is defeating the purpose. So before I go out and buy a new replacement (like I did for the crappy glove box) dash - do any other Fiat 500 or Gucci owners have any experience cleaning the soft dash?

      "True. Each amalgamation of brands before were set up over a long time to stand alone and cover all corners. Now we've got multiples of everything. It'll be like the consolidation of Sainsbury's Argos... basically Fiat being the Argos. It'll just get brushed into the nearest Stellantis brand dealer as we've all mentioned a few times. And a lot of the left over Fiat stuff gone if it presents a threat or doesn't appeal to consumers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Take all of us on here. We all love Fiat and probably represented its repeat customers - as well as the high volume of young girls from well off families buying new-500s in the millions.. Well none of us would touch a PSA / Stellantis Fiat. Even with the decent looks of the new 600. Even if they make the next Panda great-looking there will be a total lack of real Italian engineering or mechanical bits. Brand is basically dead and loyal following more than likely cut. \n",
      "\n",
      "With Vauxhall though, a lot of the older recurring trade-in folks who got Mokka's on motability have stayed loyal to the brand and now all have the current Mokka... They'll probably keep 'buying Vauxhall' not even realising the business stuff that's changed in the last 5 years. But Vauxhall had a wide, everyman appeal. Fiat I reckon, at least in the UK has always been relatively niche. The loyal Fiat folks aren't interested anymore. The young women that I guess made up a lot of the 500's commercial success, well they also ate up the DS3 when it was current and plenty of A1's and Mini's driven by the same crowd. So even with a nice new 500, can they retain those customers who maybe didn't care so much about it being a Fiat, but sheer looks?\n",
      "\n",
      "Having stewed on this topic a lot personally, and feeling bad for the people at Fiat (designers, engineers, marketing people who now have to compromise with Stellantis) - there's a bit of anger here, because had they used the money from the phenomenal sales of the 500 and Panda WISELY, we could have skipped the 500L and to some extent, the TIpo which could have been amazing and still not tempted anyone from a Golf or Focus, let alone i30s and Rio's that dominated the last decade here... and focused on perhaps divulging on a cheap bare bones Panda, and a bit more upmarket one / including 4x4 model... a 500 that was cutesy and something a bit more generic for wider appeal (5 door Mini seemed to work for Mini somehow!). If Fiat had've used its resources and strengths a bit better after the TwinAir came out, would it be here today? Surely it was just as aware of and in a position to take EV tech into its sights as much as PSA and VAG have. There's really not much excuse, other than maybe lacking sales of the non 500/Panda models perhaps were a waste of its money... I guess they had to try and appeal in other market segments but honestly the C-segment is a tough one. Maybe they're paying the price for not acting faster and with more precision over its own models. \n",
      "\n",
      "Up until now engine tech has always been a tricky one hasn't it? The 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 diesel in the Panda's were only just capable of moving bigger segment cars. A bigger engine usually was its own line or range of bigger sizes for bigger segment cars. With the EV stuff, seems like the same core technology can be applied to small city cars in a lesser capacity (smaller battery / motor) and then scaled up to fit in bigger cars easier and with more similarities than the 1.0, 1.6, 2.0 + engines which all had major differences stopping them from saving on sharing them, let alone the size limitations on some. Perhaps in the new era, the exact same EV tech in Stellantis will make it so they can afford to have more models and options / badge choices without the costs in the past that led things like Lancia to fade away for the most part. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can't get rid of my Avensis and it'll probably be a long time before the thing gives up being a Toyota (unless BMW's N47 has anything to do with it). But in the mean time, I am watching Fiat very closely and seeing what they do next. There isn't even a glimmer of hope it'll be anything but Peugeot driven badge-engineering. But still.. we will have to wait and see. The EV thing is still unfolding. I think for a while it was looking promising but now that it's more normalised everywhere perhaps the figures aren't quite as fast as expected. That will probably dictate what happens with Stellantis quite a bit. If it all thrives, they will too. If consumers reject them... I can't say where we'll be in ten years or more. I think running an EV company will be totally different than running an ICE car company as it has been until now. I think Stellantis and reshuffles in VAG are a testament to this.\n",

However, the rods don't have any lip or anything to stop them potentially slipping out of the bushes. I've seen people either welding them in place (but I don't have a welder) or bashing the top to stop slippage (which seems a it crude); the only place I've seen replacements which actually have a proper lip are these from Axel Gerstl. They are like fat nails with a flat head which would stop the rod slipping down.

      "Content: Hello -- first time posting. I have a 1973 Fiat 500 that has an R model chassis, but an older F/L engine and non-synchro trans. Starter on top of bell housing. The car was brought over from Italy many years ago. It has the round instrument cluster -- like the earlier cars. I am told that the VIN 110 F 5112103 is a 1973. The ID plate also says Motore 126 A6 000.\n",

      "Question #1 : Will the older half shafts be of the correct length and fit to this R chassis? Would the original engine and trans have been different?

I did not buy a new clutch assembly, as the car came with some new parts - the clutch being one of them. It is the diaphragm type. Unfortunately, I did not have the flywheel surfaced (just cleaned it up with Scotchbrite). It seemed to have a little corrosion. I cleaned all contact areas of plate and flywheel with acetone before assembling. I do see an oil leak that I think is from the crank seal, but also probably the trans input shaft seal as well (90 wt. oil). The clutch plates do not appear to be wet, but I sprayed them a lot with cleaner to make sure. But the chatter is still there. If I have to replace the crank seal, can it be done with the crankshaft in place? Just remove and reinstall the bearing assembly using a new seal? Are new flywheels available? Need advice / help on what to do next. Thanks for any and all helpful input.\n",

I've been seriously contemplating coming back to Fiat as per my other thread, naturally I wanted to come back to the Panda but I'm finding they are insanely priced compared to just a few years ago. Shockingly, even here in NI where we pay a bit more for used cars, I'm seeing a lot of quite new, quite decent spec 500 models. This one in particular has the bigger touch screen, new engine, TFT cluster, glass roof, and nice leather steering wheel etc - and it's only two years old and low miles. When I had one for a week in 2019 (a grey one with the white interior) I actually enjoy driving it, but I did get weird looks.

      "I have restored a couple classic American cars, some motorcycles, and have designed and built a handful of Formula SAE cars in college, but I've always wanted to build my own motorcycle powered road car.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a decade of working at one of the largest Spacecraft companies in California, I decided to take a break and try to make this dream a reality. The car needed to be simple, lightweight, relatively cheap, and older than 1975 (California smog requirements). I have a buddy that did this with an old Honda S600, and another with a Fiat 850 spider, but I wanted to do something a bit less roadster-y. Then, as the wife and I were honeymooning in Italy, I saw the answer: the old Cinquecento.\n",

      "There seems to be lots of motorcycle powered 500s for hill climbing, and Z-Cars is one of the most popular swaps out there with their Suzuki Hayabusa swapped \"Fiabusa\" (they also make a Subaru swapped \"Fubaru\"), but I wanted to keep the motor air cooled (no big radiator up front) and Italian. After a bit of research, I decided to go with my favorite motorcycle engine, a Ducati 1100. The last of the big, air cooled, dry clutch L-Twins. How hilariously adorable would this car be with that noise coming out of it?\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent a few months looking for the perfect car - something that was driveable, in decent shape, but not too nice, so I could save money up front and put it toward the swap. I ended up with a clean-ish 1974 Fiat 500 R with about 26,000 km on the clock that had been imported into the states a few years prior. The body was in pretty good shape until a strap broke towing it home resulting in a head on collision with the trailer. I minimally repaired the damaged area so I could turn the wheels full lock again, then drove it around a few months until I got the car registered.\n",

      "Title: General Fiddling with the 500 single din radio - a couple of questions\n",
      "Content: Yet another 'experimental, to be continued' thread, but whilst removing the boost gauge I had a little play with the single din radio in my Abarth 595 Turismo. The sound quality's not great and the radio signal quality is awful (I DO NOT want to spend all my time listening to Heart Radio!  ) so decided to experiment with an old Sony media centre I had knocking around whilst the 'proper' stereo was sitting in the passenger footwell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looked straightforward but when I plugged it in, no power. This is because there's no direct switched (or unswitched) +12v supply to the DIN style stereo plug, it takes it's power from the CAN bus. This has 2 issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No chance of using anything which doesn't take it's power from the CAN bus\n",
      "Draw too much power from the CAN bus (e.g. with a higher powered stereo) and that delicate i2c CAN bus wiring (or something more expensive) will go pop\n",
      "\n",
      "However there's a normal ground, so for my experiment I simply ran a flying lead from +12v to the switched power input for the stereo, and plugged everything else in as normal. Much better sound quality, and it picked up 5 more radio stations. Still not perfect by a long stretch, but better. Fiddling with the roof aerial got a couple more, but still nowhere near as good as you'd expect. So looks like I'll be replacing the roof aerial with something a bit better, most likely the stereo too\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brings me to 3 questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyone know what size the aerial hole is on a Fiat 500? I've noticed some rather nice amplified shark fins for sale in Germany (unlike the useless ornaments we have in the UK) which would look perfect and improve the signal, but need to know what size aerial I'd need. I can supply the answer to this myself in due course if nobody knows\n",
      "Assuming I run a +12v switched power outlet to the DIN plug (I'll need it for the replacement boost gauge anyway, and the amplified aerial) are there any single DIN stereos around which can connect to the handy USB port near the gear lever, either with or without an adapter? Not too bothered about the steering wheel controls, though those would be nice to have.\n",
      "I've seen lots of mentions of the speedo flashing if the standard radio is removed. Mine doesn't (or at least didn't during my 30 min fiddling), is this normal for a UK spec car or can I expect all hell to break loose at some time?\n",

First job underseal and i used a two pack which I could add body colour to (white).The next was sorting out what was missing. The first thing it was a 126 engine but the wrong gearbox so on to Ebay. when I was under sealing I rolled the shell on is side to make it easier . I replaced all brake lines cylinders and shoes. I started the engine on the floor of my garage as I didn't want to find a fault when installed but it was ok. When built and painted I took it for a MOT and found the steering horrible and I could no dial it out at the box. So then converted it to rack and pinion and oh what a difference a joy to drive. Apart from a few small niggles its been great. Now what to do next and it has to be narrow because of drive.\n",

When I finally had got around to learning to drive and scraping together the money I looked at the Fiat website, set up a configuration that I could afford and went to a dealership in Birmingham to arrange a test drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Problem 1:\n",
      "Having phoned the dealership in advance to check they had a Twinair to test drive they said they did have one. When I arrived they did have one, but it was parked in the showroom and they couldn't get it out. So I drove a 1.2 instead. Not the end of the world, but not great customer service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Problem 2:\n",
      "In fact, it was clear that the young salesman was desperate to sell me a 1.2. Now the FIRE engine is a very impressive piece of technology, very reliable and still fun, but I wanted a Twinair. What's more I was happy to pay extra for leather and ESP. The manager was called in and farcically, I ended up feeling like I was inconveniencing them by attempting to order a car that they couldn't deliver from stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave up on the Birmingham dealership and tried again with a dealership near my family's home in Oxfordshire a week later. I said that I had a poor experience with a previous dealership and that I just wanted a dealership that could competently fulfil a factory order. Initially this all seemed ok, and the car order was put in. Though the dealership failed to respond to a few simple email queries in the mean time, they did give me an ETA for the car about five weeks after I ordered. I made a further journey down to them to sign the finance documents and waited for the car to arrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was late February by this stage and the dealership gave me the option of having my car handed over immediately on 61 plates or waiting till March 1st so that it could be registered on 12 plates. I live and work in Birmingham and had booked to get an iPod compatible stereo and towbar fitted there the following week. So I opted to have it delivered on February 26th so I could drive it to Birmingham the following day (my day off). That's 11 days after the car arrived on UK soil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Problem 3:\n",
      "At the last minute on the evening of the 24th I was told that my car hasn't arrived at the dealership and that it would arrive at the latest on the 27th. On the 27th when I phone up to enquire, the dealership says that the transporting company has now delayed its arrival to the 1st March. The dealership offer me a courtesy car and pointed out that the situation was the fault of Fiat UK, neither of which was helpful to me. They stated that it would be very difficult to get the car changed onto 12 plates, despite the fact that the first day it could be given to me would be the 1st March. That will be 15 days after the car arrived in the UK.\n",
      "\n",
      "So first I am made to feel unreasonable for wanting to buy my car in the first place, then it is delivered late, probably on last year's plates and I have had to change all of my plans to get its extra accessories fitted. I've also paid nearly list price for all of this trouble.\n",

      "1) Have I just been unlucky with my two dealerships?\n",

      "\n",
      "- squeaking & grinding noise from the brakes\n",
      "- pedal vibration under heavy braking\n",
      "- excessive pad &/or disc wear\n",
      "- excessive build up of brake dust on the wheels\n",
      "- poor fuel consumption\n",
      "\n",
      "then you might want to read on.\n",
      "\n",
      "My investigations have thus far been confined to the front brakes on the 1.2 500 & Panda (which have identical systems EXCEPT there is no brake wear warning wire on the Panda), but I'd expect to find something broadly similar with the rear setup on the 1.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've now stripped down the brakes on both my cars in order to address one or more of the issues identified above. Here's what I've found.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brakes are of a single piston floating caliper design, sliding on a single bolt at the top, and retained by a simple pin at the bottom. The bolt on which the caliper slides is well greased when new & is fully enclosed in a protective rubber sleeve. The pads are released by removing the lower pin & (carefully) rotating the caliper out of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I find that on both my cars, once the pads have been removed, the caliper slides freely on its bolt - there is no problem with the design of the caliper and this part of the system works exactly as its designer intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further dismanting involves removing the caliper by unscrewing the single bolt on which it slides, then removing the reaction frame by unscrewing the two bolts which secure it. Once you have removed the reaction frame, inspect the surfaces on which the pads slide & the real cause of all the problems will be obvious.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reaction frame is made from a grade of cast iron which has a very low corrosion resistance, and even on an almost-new car, these sliding surfaces will be significantly corroded - preventing the pads from sliding freely. This doesn't really affect safety, as there's a huge amount of hydraulic pressure available to force the pads into the disc & stop the car, but there's no comparable force available to help them release afterwards, so instead of moving back out when you take your foot off the pedal, they bind in the frames & cause the brakes to drag - leading to all the problems identified in the introduction. In the worst case, the pads will actually seize solid in the frames & then the hydraulic pressure will start bending the pads. Mark Elvin posted a good picture of what happens if this occurs, here:\n",
      "\n",
      "http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/markelvin/IMAG0156.jpg\n",
      "\n",
      "The only solution that's actually going to work for any length of time is to remove the reaction frames, thoroughly clean the sliding surfaces, apply a generous helping of copperease & carefully reassemble, taking great care not to get the copperease on the discs. I've now done this to both my cars, and the improvement in braking performance is quite noticeable, particularly when braking gently. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've attached some pictures to show the process - just click to enlarge. I've included a 'before & after\" shot after cleaning out just one side of the frame. The extent of corrosion buildup is remarkable after only a short time in service - the car had done less than 3000 miles when they were taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took a considerable effort with the rotary wire brush to remove the dirt & corrosion & IMO you can't properly fix this without removing the reaction frames from the car, even if you're just changing the pads.\n",
      "\n",

Strange,i unplugged and plugged back in the stick and media player came on, thought I'll checkout this web site for tips on the repeat track prob and hey presto, its a setting, a setting the tech wizards at fiat obviously dont know about. The seat which rattles a bit and needs tightening they tell me they'll have to remove the whole back seat to do this, bit worrying, think i'll be checking this out myself in the daylight tomorrow before i take it in. The last one, the misting up is very worrying, i told them it mists up rather alot and wanted them just to check the seals on doors etc, they booked it in for 1 hour for a water test, i got there and the service engineer came to me and said he cant do a water test in 1 hour, so i said well why havent i been told it was this long, he replied we have to remove the whole interior to conduct a water test, wow, wow, wow i said then NO NO NO, your not removing the whole interior of a brand new car which will rattle like hell after. I just cant believe the experience, the car truely is great but the clowns selling them and fixing well fiddling with them just let the whole experience down. Double, no tripple check any faults first through this site is all i can say. Thanks again guys and sorry its so long, but dont want anyone else having my poor experience.\n",

      "Fiat have clearly been a nightmare to deal with for years or the dealers, and now they are dead in the water, no proper Fiat products to come, and the fact that soon they will have no identity save a badge. Customers have always been enthusiasts or left field, and backed by those needing a cheap car, who have been delighted with the product once bitten and often become loyal. The Fiat twin cam developed its own cult too. They had a reasonable market position but failed to back it or develop anything to encourage follow on for a maturing owner, In future if you want a Peugeot you will probaly just buy one. Not a renadged Fiat. Now there is really nothing left for that market, and at a time when their products could still gain a strong following, had they majored on small petrol and value, they have thrown whatever was left down the toilet. Their electric products are above their pay grade. I feel that selling my newer Fiat now would be sensible, because if spares get hard to find the value will plummet. I wouldnt consider Fiat if buting new, and I dislike Peiigeot as they cheated my dad out of a lot of money in the 90's and I had CItroens until they nearly bankrupted me. Both his Peugeots were mechanical disaters and cost us both huge amounts of money. They dont know how to make a supportive seat either. No way ever again, genuinely I would revert to a bicycle first. Fiat UK seem to have been run by some really stupid and lazy people as far as I can see, hence its no suprise to see them help kill the brand. Im sure many people think there is no point in buying a new ICE car no anyway. Future very uncertain and values worrying for the fear of tax strangulation ahead and the frankly propsterous current price hikes. New sales must be collapsing and the whole market will collapse if nothing is done to help it. In the current economic circumstances people will short change their cars on servicing which will add to the dealers angst. Many people, me included , think servicing an electric car will be a con and will not service the electric cars properly, and I think thee thinngs will be money pits as a result (second hnd) with braking systems being a n=big point of failure and therfore cost. Dont mention down the line battery issues. The electric secondhand market scares me. I dont want to get imvolved in something I cant undertsand - because its entirely new. The future of transport looks gloomy if you cant afford to join the leasing club a very old classic may be the way to go if they are not banned entirely..\n",

      "Content: Hello All\n",
      "I'm a newby here after just picking up my 1.3MJT 95bhp last week. Its a 6 month old car with 3k miles on the clock. I am generally happy with the car except for the fuel consumption. I've downsized from a Fabia vRS 1.9TDi 130bhp and the fuel consumption on the 500 seems no better!? I would pretty much always get 45-50mpg from the Fabia however I drove it but a reasonable mixture of roads and 200 miles, and the computer is showing me 48mpg, surely this cant be right? I was expecting 60mpg average from everything that I read. What are other owners getting out of their cars? and what should I expect from long mway/dual carriageway runs at 80mph ?\n",

He told us a replacement from Fiat would be about €200.\n",

      "Fiat Auto UK has teamed up with console games giant, Xbox, to add extra appeal to an attractive pair of exclusive limited edition offers: the Punto Xbox and Stilo Xbox, which go on sale at UK Fiat dealers this weekend, (22/23 January).\n",
      "\n",
      "The £8995 OTR, Punto Xbox is based on the Punto Active Sport 1.2 16v, yet features a lower purchase price, while becoming available with almost £600 worth of exclusive features. These include black metallic paint, Xbox badging and interior mats, an MP3 player and 100W subwoofer, and steering wheel mounted audio controls. All of which adds to Punto Active Sport's attractive standard equipment package of 15 inch alloy wheels, sports bumpers and rear spoiler, 6-speaker radio/CD player, and leather steering wheel and gear lever knob.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stilo Xbox is priced at £11,995 OTR, some £500 more than the Stilo Active Sport 1.6 16v on which it is based, but with almost £1500 worth of added features, customers will benefit from almost £1000 of added value. Features include Xbox badging and interior mats, 17\" alloy wheels, black metallic paint, MP3 player and 100W subwoofer, air conditioning, steering wheel mounted audio controls, and sports pedals.\n",
      "\n",
      "These exclusive features blend with Stilo Active Sport's standard specification which includes side skirts and rear spoiler, a sporty interior, radio/CD player with six speakers and a leather steering wheel and gear lever knob.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these two exciting special edition vehicles are only part of the Fiat/Xbox partnership story, because not only will all retail customers receive a free Xbox console and demo version of the eagerly awaited new Forza Motorsport driving game - not officially launched until April - with every Punto or Stilo Xbox purchase, but Fiat Auto UK has created a stylish and interactive new microsite at www.fiat.co.uk/xbox for customers, that went live on 10 January. The microsite allows customers to interact with key elements of the cars, and there are mutual links to Xbox.com and to Fiat dealers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The activity is supported by a three month ‘advertorial' campaign in leading titles such as FHM, and by a nationwide radio promotion. Additionally, Fiat Auto UK will be mailing some 50,000 customer prospects, inviting them to participate in a competition at Fiat dealers over the weekend of 22/23 January. All this activity will be backed up by a widely circulated E-DM communication, promoting the campaign to 100,000 customer prospects.\n",
      "\n",
      "The customer competition being staged this weekend invites visitors to the dealership to set their fastest lap time on the Forza Motorsport demo game, and those taking part will have the chance to win both an Xbox console and the Forza game itself. The top 10 scores from across the dealer network will also be published on the Xbox micro-site.\n",

Fiat are offering no discount as such on this vehicle due to its popularity, so the price won,t be any different. I know for a fact that a dealer in Cambridge (EMG Motor Group) actually have around 5 different models ready for amediate delivery!!!!!!!!\n",

Let's face it, you dont' walk into a dealership and say to the salesman, 'I love the look of the car, the door handles look nice, are there any reliability issues with them?' Both of our 500's had door handles replaced by the way, thankfully, both under warranty. Still the only car I've ever owned where this has been a problem, except for a Metro I owned over 25 years ago when the driver side handle snapped off during very cold weather, sending me sprawling onto the pavement and causing me to hit my head on the kerb. I've never been the same since lol! \n",

I know a new look takes some getting used to and might improve with familiarity, but this not really a new look so I don't think that's a factor. Have to say I think it's a mess; (all this in my opinion) the exterior is bitty with poorly co-ordinated details, especially at the front, the Dan Dare chin is just ugly, and there's a generally fussy look that I find unappealing; the fenders on the doors are also particularly ugly; the interior is better than I expected - I don't like gimmicky shapes on dashboards but the squircle was not as obtrusive as I feared, however, I would prefer instruments and bezels to be round and the whole effect to be less fussy (again); not sure about the coloured panel in the fascia either - not clear to me which model/s have it which don't.

      "Title: General My opinion about downsizing and 500 vs Mini\n",
      "Content: There is another recent thread on here about people downsizing from larger cars to the 500. I saw it in the flesh a couple of Sundays ago and ordered one on the following tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "My Honda Civic (new diesel version) was hardly being used and was costing me £400 and £115 tax plus servicing to insure. Although I lost a lot, I decided to get rid and it sold to a private buyer last night. The quote for my 1.3 500's insurance was only £190 plus £35 road tax, so my running costs will reduce quite dramatically. I'm looking forward to getting it in two weeks time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used to have a Mini, the first generation BMW one and used to think it was lovely. It was however unreliable, needing a new gearbox, new steering column and new steering motor. Looking back on it, although it was a hoot to drive, it actually had no purity or class about it and it was extremely badly packaged to boot. Bloated and overrated. Sorry Mini fans.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fiat on the other hand is much more honest. It is well packaged and looks as if it will be reliable. Even Which rate the Panda's reliability, although diss the brand in general. Once I've had it for a few months I will be able to make a better judgement about whether it fulfils the criteria of what a small car should be. It needs to make a couple of journeys from The South East to Scotland a couple of times a year and the crunch point will be seing how well it performs at this task. I had a 53 reg Vauxhall Corsa 1.0 litre with semi-auto gearbox, like the Fiat system, and although the car was widely criticised in the automotive press, it was honest and great fun to drive. It was utterly gutless and handled like a pig. I drove it to Newcastle from London a couple of times, and half the fun was keeping the revs as high as possible to achieve reasonable performance. It had a top speed of about 85mph and needed careful forward planning to maintain momentum on motorways. I suspect it would be very similar drive in the 1.2 Fiat 500, although the Fiat will be better due to its handling abilities, therefore even more fun....\n",
      "\n",
      "One further point. I would like to predict something too. I hope I am wrong about the prediction: only time will tell. The Mini had great residual value, there is no doubting that. I believe that the 500 will fall at this hurdle once it becomes more widely available, say in a couple of years time. Once the supply has caught up with demand, i suspect Fiat will be up to its old tricks and start discounting heavily as it has done with the Panda. This will make it depreciate more quickly unless you have managed to get one at a good discount initially. Also, I think the perception of Fiat in the UK needs to change. I realise it is probably as reliable as VW for example but some of the dealers really need to pull their socks up! This is just a gut feeling and a hunch that has inspired this doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I have purchased the car from the Fiat showroom in Central London, who have not opened their service centre (in Battersea) yet, can anyone recommend a good dealer, preferably in the Midlands area within a 100 miles drive of North London? Servicing generally tends to be cheaper in the midlands and I would rather visit a dealer with a good record. Is the dealer in Warwick (Grays) any good? Recommendations please!!\n",

It is only a few months old, driving it was such a pleasure after the experience of the last few months. Financially it has been a serious blow, even if our dealer accepts our rejection of the car. The main cause we have given is that the erratic throttle response makes driving hazardous and also makes a nonsense of the 'Learn how to drive it' line that Fiat keeps pushing.\n",

Most of the repair kits seem to be on the same lines as these from Ricambio i.e. a plain steel rod/dowel with a couple of nylon bushes. However, the rods don't have any lip or anything to stop them potentially slipping out of the bushes. I've seen people either welding them in place (but I don't have a welder) or bashing the top to stop slippage (which seems a it crude); the only place I've seen replacements which actually have a proper lip are these from Axel Gerstl. They are like fat nails with a flat head which would stop the rod slipping down.

I know a new look takes some getting used to and might improve with familiarity, but this not really a new look so I don't think that's a factor. Have to say I think it's a mess; (all this in my opinion) the exterior is bitty with poorly co-ordinated details, especially at the front, the Dan Dare chin is just ugly, and there's a generally fussy look that I find unappealing; the fenders on the doors are also particularly ugly; the interior is better than I expected - I don't like gimmicky shapes on dashboards but the squircle was not as obtrusive as I feared, however, I would prefer instruments and bezels to be round and the whole effect to be less fussy (again); not sure about the coloured panel in the fascia either - not clear to me which model/s have it which don't.

They also noticed a broken clip on the 2-inch-diameter induction pipe - centre of the second attached JPEG.

      "Content: I'm slowly getting closer to sending the required forms to the DVLA to register the car (only the MOT to pass ). Looking at the paperwork - the DVLA require the date of first registration; however, the original Italian paperwork I have (Carta di Circolazione) only shows the year of first registration and not a specific date (it shows a dd.mm.yy date of a later registration as I understand Italian registration numbers follow the owner not the car). Given that UK reg number year identifiers change(d) part of the way through the year, will the DVLA insist on knowing at least the month of first registration? If so, do you know where I can get that? Any help/suggestions from those who have been through this gratefully received. I know I could call the DVLA but getting a response here is probably quicker\n",

      "\n",
      "I went to their showrooms on Wednesday of last week and spoke to one of their salesmen. Wasn't sure quite what I wanted, but they had a lovely 1.3Mj Lounge with lots of extras in the showroom, already registered (in Feb 08 looking at tax disc) but with delivery miles as it was a cancelled order. The salesman advised me it was £11,400. Unsure of whether I wanted a diesel or not, I decided to take an identical car for a test drive. That was the clincher. \n",
      "\n",
      "Arriving back at the showroom, I told the salesman I wanted to buy the pre-registered Lounge and asked what they could give me for my GP in part-ex. He disappeared for a few minutes to speak to his manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sorry the lounge is £11,975\" he said.\n",
      "\"I thought you said it was £11,400?\" I replied.\n",
      "\"Yeh sorry I was wrong- it's £400 off list price I got confused\" he said \n",
      "\"Right... ok so what are you going to give me for mine?\" I asked, already a bit miffed that the price had increased.\n",
      "\"£6000 we will give you which is above book price\" he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking I was getting a bargain, I signed and paid my £500 deposit. I then left for work as I hadn't time to finish the paperwork. I promised to return the next day to sign the dotted line. On returning home, I thought i'd check the list of extras and was annoyed to discover that £11,975 was in fact the normal list price and NOT the £400 discount the salesman has told me I was getting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning (Thursday) I returned to sign the paperwork. The guy who had served me the day before wasn't there and neither was the manager. I spoke to another salesman and told him I wasn't happy that I had been told that I was getting a £400 discount when, in fact, I wasn't. He looked at me as if to say \"well what do you expect me to do?\". I had asked for a spoiler to be fitted to the car as an extra, and this salesman said they would probably add it for free to make up for the misunderstanding. He wrote this on the order form, but also wrote that it would be subject to confirmation with his manager who was uncontactable that day. Happy with that, I left.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, the original salesman I had dealt with called me to say that they would NOT give me the spoiler for free. I pointed out that he had a) increased the price of the car after I had agreed to buy it and b) lied to me that I was getting a £400 discount off list price, but his reply was that they were giving me above book price for my GP. I pointed out that this was irrelevant as that price was agreed AFTER he had tld me that £11,975 was a £400 discount off list. So I said that I may as well buy a brand new unregistered 500 and he said fine but we cant give you £6000 for your GP ona new one. A heated discussion ensued on the phone during which I threatened to pull out of the sale and take my £500 deposit back. He didn't say it, specifically, but he more or less hinted that they wouldn't give me my £500 back.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what would you do? This whole experience has left a really sour taste in my mouth and I don't actually feel as if I want to spend £12k on a Fiat any more. I love the pre-registered Lounge but when I think about it I feel as if they are trying to take me for a mug and I don't want to give SGM Fiat a single penny of my money.\n",

      "Content: So here goes. I've wanted one of these for a very long time. I loved the basic Pandas when I was an apprentice at Mangoletsi, and when the 100hp's were released I fell in love. One bouncy drive round rural Cheshire and I was hooked. Bear in mind at the time I was driving a 1.3 Vauxhall Nova (and I'd have another, but have you seen the prices!) and there was a lot to compare. Small, fun, nippy, head turning. Fast forward a few years, two more Novas (rot boxes), two cavaliers (reliable, if a little old fashioned), a corolla (boring), mk2 golf GTi (VW couldn't make cars then, still can't now. Awful) and a Merc c200 (lovely car, still got a sick feeling about trading it in) I changed garages, got bored and ended up back where I started earlier this year. And a plan formed.\n",
      "I started looking a few weeks back, and with some money saved I set myself a £3k budget. Plenty around for that price and less, but all at least 50 miles away. I wanted a grey one, with clean bodywork. Not a big ask I thought. Boy was I wrong. \n",

      "I drove a 120 mile round trip to view a 90,000 mile, 1 owner, full service history at £2k. When I arrived, there was a dent in the door and the wing, and the front bumper was peppered with stone chips, but it was honest, 90% dealer service history, and drove like a new car. I politely told the seller I would let him know as I was looking at a couple of others. One low mileage sold before I could look, but there was a 54k \"mint car\" up towards Leeds. Saturday lunch I set off. It wasn't mint. Large dent in the roof, the underside looked like it had been parked in the sea, and it just didn't feel right. I walked away, got in touch with the first one, and asked if he'd take my mechanically good, bodywork bad Merc in part ex. I was only asking £300 for the merc, (I bought it for £400 over two years ago, not bad depreciation!), and that's what he offered. So after a 150 mile round trip to Leeds, I got back in my car and drove back to Mansfield. \n",

When I completed the order the salesmen said that he could not find an option to add the \"predisposition\" for the plug in (68R) port so that I could buy a TomTom Sat Nav as an accessory. Now this really is déjà vue as when I ordered my current 500c from new in 2010 the salesman forgot to put the 68R port on the factory order and it duly arrived without one. Guess what? I wouldn't accept the car. The dealer had to order another which meant another 8 weeks, I think the salesman lost his job but I wasn't in a hurry and, hey, I don't like unsightly wires\n",

      "Content: I was at the Fiat dealer today, and I happened to run into a Fiat 500 L in the showroom! I was pleasantly surprised, so I immediately went to have a look. First impression; it is HUGE compared to the 500. I mean really huge, the roof feels twice as high! (I think the fact that the showroom car didn't have a panorama glass or sunroof did add to the fact but still huge). You would need to be over 7ft tall to have issues with the headroom!! The front of it reminded me of the 500, the rims are nice, the back not at all it is really square looks like a MPV back! Inside, it is really huge, think Mini Countryman style, I sat in the back and I fit comfortably at 6ft 3. In fact it kept on reminding me of the Countryman with the higher ride height, the accessible doors, and the front seat. I prefer the Countryman to be honest interior wise, but it is a good deal cheaper than the Mini Countryman, so it feels like the cheap version of that!\n",
      "\n",
      "The interior reminded me of it being more of a big brother of the Panda than the 500, it does not have the same charisma. I must say though it is INFINITELY more practical than the 500, you really don't need a car bigger than the 500 L. Its like a golf but a bit bigger and higher. When the salesman friend said that it handles very well, I asked him if I could test drive it; he said yeah sure call me tomorrow! So I think tomorrow I will have a drive! They have the 1.4 version as a test car so it should be quite interesting to compare it to my 500 1.4, I guess it would be slower as it is MUCH bigger than the normal 500.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I was quite impressed, and with the price being quite reasonable for such a big car (19,000 euros for the showroom version which was a diesel and according to the dealer, pop star is the mid range version), it is definitely a good buy for someone with dogs and kids. The boot proper massive, at least twice as much space as the 500! I'll let you guys know how she drives tomorrow, lets see if the dealer is saying the truth with his 'good handling' claim!\n",
      "\n",
      "Between the two, I would still go for the 500 normal though, but there again as a bachelor I really don't need the space and many people really do!\n",

Sometimes you just gotta take that little leap of faith I guess, it wouldn't be the first time I've bought a car I've not even sat in before!

      "It's Luca di Montezemolo, chairman of Fiat, who has been the catalyst for this sudden upturn in fortunes, with ground zero being reached when the stilo started to glue itself to the showroom floors right across Europe last year. Montezomolo realised that if he didn't act quickly Fiat could be permanently damaged by the lack of flair within its range. \n",

He called his good friend guissepe Bonnollo (then Ferrari's director of product strategy) to tell him the news, but discovered he had got the call too. Quickly they realised this wasn't a slap in the face after all but rather a once in a lifetime opportunity to revitalise the historic brand. \n",

Next will come the exciting new stilo replacement, rushed through 18 months earlier than planned, followed by a sporting Grande Punto Turbo. Then, late in 2007, the cute little Fiat 500 will arrive, with a line-up that will include a hot Abarth version. It's my prediction that, when it arrives, this little car is going to give BMW's mini it's first serious competition; ironically it was Frank Stephenson (when he worked at BMW) who designed the new Mini in the first place...\"\n",

      "For whatever reason Italians love the Panda. Far more than the 500 which has less than half its sales at home. The 500 sells equally well when considered across European markets but with a much smaller home market skew. The point I was making wasn't that home bias doesn't exist - is that it's not unique to Fiat. Other brands do much better in their home market too. I don't disagree the Panda needs replacing - the original discussion was - is the Panda a worse car than the Up/Mii/Citigo? Owning a Panda and an Up! clone has surprised me - despite the fact the Panda is old it more than holds its own in comparison. I will use it in preference to the other. I only use the other one if it's parked behind the Panda. The Citigo is slower, gives me backache and, in the summer, the aircon can't blow the skin off a rice pudding. It also constantly mists up in winter - it's not all negative-the main advantages are - more room inside and it's better for carrying people and their luggage, it achieves another 5mpg when measured fill to fill - the layout of the pedals is also less eccentric - although it has no footrest. But if I'm travelling alone I choose the Panda everytime. I enjoy driving it - especially on faster roads where the other car is a gutless pain.\n",

      "Content: I've just been to Stoneacre fiat in Peterborough who tell me it needs 4x new glow plugs (£19.95) and a new control unit (£79.99) plus labour. They are waiting to see if Fiat will cover it as part of the third year dealer warranty as it's just over two years old. I must say I am surprised that all 4 glow plugs need replacing and it needs a new control unit. It only has 20k on the clock and I am always careful not to turn the engine till the glow plug sign goes out. I hope Fiat will cover this or else I will be very disappointed and out of pocket. Will let you know whether this is covered or not.\n",

It will be available in two sophisticated body colours: white with glitter and brushed chrome-plated elements, and black with glitter and shiny chrome-plated accents. For both, the soft top is black with the characteristic green-red-green Gucci web pattern printed lengthwise.\n",

The Gucci web theme also appears on the seats, gearbox, key cover, mats, and, with an innovative finish, on the seat belts.\n",

      "Content: I was not sure if the starter motor I was using to turn over my recently built 540cc engine was quite doing the job so thought I would rebuild one. Checked my garage shelves and I had 5 Fiat 500 Starter Motors to suit the 499cc. How can I select the best I thought so only one thing for it, pull the first four apart to see what I will find. Realised that I had picked up one 594/650 one by mistake but that indulged my nerdy side being able to compare developments as they evolved. Found a few shocking bits and some worn or missing bits which I will show later. Reading the Haynes manual added to the knowledge and interest. So two good starters assembled so far, one for my own use and one up for grabs if anyone needs one. Also it seems that no UK suppliers have the thin steel plate that fits between the starter and the gearbox bellhousing and I have a couple going spare. These seem to be one of the bits that often get left off when an engine get reassembled. I defy anybody to fit one of those rubber boots over the lever without it tearing. My advice is to cut it strategically before attempting to fit.\n",
